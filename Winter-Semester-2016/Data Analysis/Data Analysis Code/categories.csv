15110370,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15110370,Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Veszprém,"The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Veszprém (, ) is an Archdiocese of the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church in Hungary. Believed to have been established in 1009 AD by King Stephen I of Hungary, as the Diocese of Veszprém, the diocese was originally a suffragan to the Archdiocese of Esztergom. In 1992, the Diocese was elevated to an Archdiocese. The Archdiocese is the Metropolitan of the Diocese of Kaposvár and the Diocese of Szombathely.          The Cathedral of Veszprém is dedicated to Saint Michael. The current archbishop is Gyula Márfi who was appointed in 1997.          The circumstances of the establishment of the episcopal see in Veszprém are still under debate. It is probable that Veszprém was the habitual residence of Bishop Bruno, who had been sent to evangelise the Magyars in 972; but it was probably only in 1009 when King Stephen I of Hungary issued the Deed of Foundation of the Diocese of Veszprém. Based on the Deed of Foundation, the territory of the Diocese of Veszprém extended over the territories of the Counties of Veszprém, Fejér, Visegrád and Kolon. The Diocese of Veszprém was suffragan to the Archdiocese of Esztergom.          When the Abbey of Pannonhalma was established in 1001, King Stephen I granted the tithes of the County of Somogy to the Abbey, but the county itself still belonged to the Diocese of Veszprém.          The diocese was linked traditionally to the queen consort. Thus, the ""ius patronatus"" of the Cathedral in Veszprém was due to not only the king of Hungary but also his wife.          Based on the tradition, the bishop of Veszprém was entitled to crown queens of Hungary, and this tradition was confirmed by an agreement between Bishop Robert of Veszprém and Archbishop János of Esztergom in April 1216.          The bishop of Veszprém became also the queen's chancellor . The first bishop of Veszprém who used the title was Bertalan, Bishop of Veszprém, and in 1269 King Béla IV confirmed that the title was connected to the bishopric.          In the year 1294, Queen Fenenna confirmed that, at that time, Dowager Queen Elizabeth had the privilege to collect the donations of the church in the Veszprém County, despite being a former queen.          On 26 October 1313, King Charles I and Bishop Stephen Kéki concluded an agreement under which the Bishop ceded the tithe of Csepel Island to the King in exchange for the County of Veszprém. The agreement was confirmed, in 1392, by King Sigismund; therefore the bishops of Veszprém became also the perpetual ispáns of Veszprém.          http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dvesz.html","['History of Christianity in Hungary', 'Roman Catholic dioceses in Hungary', 'Roman Catholic Ecclesiastical Province of Veszpr\xc3\xa9m', 'Roman Catholic ecclesiastical provinces in Hungary', '1009 establishments']"

AKF seeks to provide long-term solutions to problems of poverty, hunger, illiteracy and ill health in the poorest parts of South and Central Asia, Eastern and Western Africa, and the Middle East. In these regions, the needs of rural communities in mountainous, coastal and other resource-poor areas are given particular attention. The Foundation's activities often reinforce the work of other sister agencies within the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN). While these agencies are guided by different mandates pertaining to their respective fields of expertise (the environment, culture, microfinance, health, education, architecture, rural development), their activities are often coordinated with one another in order to ""multiply"" the overall effect that the Network has in any given place or community. AKF also collaborates with local, national and international partners in order to bring about sustainable improvements of life in the 19 countries in which it works. The Foundation's head office is located in Geneva, Switzerland.          The Foundation concentrates its resources on selected issues in health, education, rural development, the environment and the strengthening of civil society. Seeking innovative approaches to generic problems, it tries to identify solutions that can be adapted to conditions in many different regions and replicated.          Cross-cutting issues that are also addressed by the Foundation include human resource development, community participation, and gender and development.          The Aga Khan Foundation is the principal grant-making agency for social development within the Aga Khan Development Network. Grants are normally given to local organizations interested in testing new solutions, in learning from experience and in being agents of lasting change. These organizations must share the Foundation's and Aga Khan Development Network's goals in their specific areas of focus. If no established group exists, the Foundation occasionally creates new organizations to tackle particularly important problems.          The Aga Khan provides the Foundation with regular funding for administration and new programme initiatives as well as contributions to its endowment. The Ismaili community contributes volunteer time, professional services and substantial financial resources. Other funding sources include income from investments and grants from government, institutional and private sector partners - as well as donations from individuals around the world.          One programme series funded by the Foundation was the BBC World News television series ""Architects on the Frontline"", which was about entries to the Aga Khan Award for Architecture competition, and was criticized by the media watchdog Ofcom for breaking United Kingdom broadcasting rules; viewers were not informed that the series, which praised the competition, was sponsored content.          Among other recognition for its work, the Foundation received the 2005 Award for Most Innovative Development Project from the Global Development Network for the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (AKRSP) in Pakistan.

34215,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34215,X-Ray Spex,"X-Ray Spex were an English punk band from London that formed in 1976.          During their first incarnation (1976–79), X-Ray Spex were “deliberate underachievers” and only managed to release five singles and one album. Nevertheless, their first single, ""Oh Bondage Up Yours!"", is now acknowledged as a classic punk rock single and the album, ""Germfree Adolescents"", is widely acclaimed as a classic album of the punk rock genre.          Initially, the band featured singer Poly Styrene (born Marion Joan Elliott-Said) (alternatively spelled Marian or Marianne) on vocals, Jak Airport (Jack Stafford) on guitars, Paul Dean on bass, Paul 'B. P.' Hurding on drums, and Lora Logic (born Susan Whitby) on saxophone. This latter instrument was an atypical addition to the standard punk instrumental line-up, and became one of the group's most distinctive features. Lora played on only one of the band's records. As she was only fifteen, playing saxophone was a hobby and she left the band to complete her education.          X-Ray Spex's other distinctive musical element was Poly Styrene's voice, which has been variously described as ""effervescently discordant"" and ""powerful enough to drill holes through sheet metal"". As Mari Elliot, Poly had released a reggae single for GTO Records in 1976, ""Silly Billy"", which had not charted. Born in 1957 in Bromley, Kent, of both Somali and British parentage, Poly Styrene became the group's public face, and remains one of the most memorable front-women to emerge from the punk movement. Unorthodox in appearance, she wore thick braces on her teeth and once stated that ""I said that I wasn't a sex symbol and that if anybody tried to make me one I'd shave my head tomorrow"". She later actually did at Johnny Rotten's flat prior to a concert at Victoria Park. Mark Paytress recounts in the liner notes for the 2002 compilation, ""The Anthology"", that Jah Wobble, Rotten's longtime friend and bassist for his post-punk venture PiL, once described Styrene as a ""strange girl who often talked of hallucinating. She freaked John out."" Rotten, known more for his outspoken dislikes and disdain than for praise and admiration, said of X-Ray Spex in a retrospective punk documentary, ""Them, they came out with a sound and attitude and a whole energy—it was just not relating to anything around it—""superb"".""          Styrene was inspired to form a band by seeing the Sex Pistols in Hastings and, through their live performances, she and X-Ray Spex became one of the most talked about acts on the infant punk scene. The band played twice at the punk club The Roxy during its first 100 days. In March, the band played with The Drones and Chelsea. In April, they shared the bill with the Buzzcocks, Wire, and Johnny Moped. Their first Roxy gig was only their second live appearance. It was recorded and their anthem ""Oh Bondage Up Yours!"" was included on the influential ""Live at the Roxy WC2"" album. Styrene was sixteen years old at the time of the recording. The publicity from this gig led to a ""near residency"", particularly on Sunday nights, at 'The Man in the Moon' pub, Kings Road, Chelsea, and record label interest.          In late September 1977, a studio recording of ""Oh Bondage Up Yours!"" was released as a single. Today, the 45 is regarded as their most enduring artefact, both as a piece of music and as a sort of proto-grrrl catchphrase. Opening with the spoken/screamed line, ""Some people think little girls should be seen and not heard but I think, oh bondage, up yours!"", the song could be interpreted as a premonition of the riot grrrl movement a good 15 years later, although Styrene herself insists it was more intended as an anti-consumerist/anti-capitalist jingle, and was not exclusively feminist in nature.          In late 1977, Lora Logic was replaced on saxophone, first temporarily by John Glyn (who later joined Wreckless Eric's band), and then permanently by Rudi Thompson (also known as Steve Rudi).          In November 1978, the band released their debut album. With the exception of ""Identity"", which was partially based on Styrene seeing a girl slash her wrists in a club toilet, the rest of ""Germfree Adolescents"" dealt with the anti consumerist theme. Indeed, ""The Guardian"" newspaper described the album as containing ""unrivalled anti-consumerism anthems"".          X-Ray Spex played at 'Front Row Festival', a three-week event at the Hope and Anchor, Islington in late November and early December 1977. This resulted in the band's inclusion, alongside the likes of Wilko Johnson, 999, The Only Ones, the Saints, The Stranglers, and XTC, on a double album of recordings from the festival. Then, in February 1978, before the release of their second single, X-Ray Spex recorded the first of two sessions for John Peel at BBC Radio 1. Their profile was further enhanced by playing a fortnight's residency at New York's CBGB's, even though the album ""Germ Free Adolescents"" was not released in America until 1992.          On 30 April 1978, the band appeared at the Rock Against Racism gig at Victoria Park, Bow, Tower Hamlets. Also on the bill were Steel Pulse, The Clash, The Ruts, Sham 69, Generation X and Tom Robinson Band. Later in the year, to promote the album, X-Ray Spex embarked on their first, and only, full UK tour. Exhausted by touring, Poly Styrene left the band in mid 1979, though she is seen performing with the band in the 1980 film, ""D.O.A."". She released a solo album, ""Translucence"", before joining the Hare Krishna movement (as did Logic, who left the band aged 16 in 1977 to form a new group called Essential Logic).          Without Styrene, the group lost its momentum and split up. Hurding and Airport went on to form Classix Nouveaux, while Paul Dean and Rudi Thompson went on to form Agent Orange with Anthony ""Tex"" Doughty, who later become a founding member of Transvision Vamp.          The first incarnation of X-Ray Spex existed from mid-1976 to 1979, during which time they released five singles—""Oh Bondage Up Yours!"", ""Identity"", ""The Day the World Turned Day-Glo"", ""Germfree Adolescents"", and ""Highly Inflammable""—and one album, ""Germfree Adolescents"". One retrospective review described the singles as “not only riveting examples of high-energy punk, but contained provocative, thoughtful lyrics berating the urban synthetic fashions of the 70s and urging individual expression”.          The same reviewer in ""The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music"" sums up the band's 1970s contribution as “one of the most inventive, original and genuinely exciting groups to emerge during the punk era”.          In 1991 X-Ray Spex reformed for a surprise sell-out gig at the Brixton Academy where Poly appeared in a blue foam dress with an army helmet (to her regret). The group reformed again in 1995 with a line-up of Styrene, Dean and Logic to release a new album ""Conscious Consumer"". Although heralded as the first in a trilogy, the album was not a commercial success. Styrene later explained that touring and promotional work suffered an abrupt end when she was run over by a fire engine in central London, suffering a fractured pelvis. The following year X-Ray Spex played at the 20th Anniversary of Punk Festival in Blackpool minus Poly Styrene, overcoming her last-minute decision to withdraw by recruiting a replacement female singer named 'Poly Filla'. The band subsequently disbanded, but later releases include a compilation of the group's early records, a live album, and an anthology of all the aforementioned.          Jak Airport later worked for the BBC's Corporate and Public Relations department under his real name, Jack Stafford; he died on 13 August 2004 of cancer.          On 28 April 2008, Poly Styrene gave a performance of ""Oh Bondage Up Yours!"" in front of more than 10,000 people at the Love Music Hate Racism free concert in Victoria Park, East London          Symond Lawes, working as Concrete Jungle Productions, together with Poly Styrene, produced the live show at Camden Roundhouse in 2008.          The band including original bass player Paul Dean, played what was described as a raucous comeback gig and in front of an audience of 3,000 full at The Roundhouse in London on 6 September 2008. The gig consisted of ""Germfree Adolescents"" in its entirety, with the exception of ""Plastic Bag"". A DVD and CD of the Roundhouse performance was released in November 2009 on the Year Zero Label by Future Noise Music.          Poly Styrene died of spinal and breast cancer on 25 April 2011 in East Sussex, England at the age of 53.

3786605,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3786605,Gail Ann Dorsey,"Gail Ann Dorsey (born November 20, 1962) is an American musician. With a distinguished career as a session musician, she is perhaps best known for her longtime residency in David Bowie's band, from 1995 to Bowie's death in 2016. Aside from playing bass, she occasionally has sung lead vocals according to Bowie's introduction on ""A Reality Tour"", on ""Under Pressure"", and duetted with him on others, including ""The London Boys"", ""Aladdin Sane (1913-1938-197?)"", ""I Dig Everything"", accompanying Bowie on clarinet, and a cover of Laurie Anderson's ""O Superman"".          From 1993 to 1996, Dorsey also recorded and toured extensively with Tears for Fears, and collaborated on songwriting within the band. She appeared in several of the band's promo videos throughout this period. Her diverse range of work includes performances and/or recordings with, among others, David Bowie, Lenny Kravitz, Bryan Ferry, Boy George, the Indigo Girls, Khaled, Jane Siberry, The The, Skin, Gwen Stefani, Charlie Watts, Seal, Gang of Four, Susan Werner, ani difranco and Dar Williams.          In addition, Dorsey has released three solo albums: ""The Corporate World"" (1988), ""Rude Blue"" (1992), and ""I Used To Be..."" (2003).          Dorsey grew up in the 1970s in West Philadelphia. She played guitar from the age of nine and cites Mark Farner of Grand Funk Railroad, Terry Kath of Chicago, Jimi Hendrix, and Nancy Wilson of Heart as early influences. She acquired a bass shortly after her 14th birthday but didn't consider herself a bass player until she was 20. She also wrote feature-length screenplays to accompany some of her musical compositions.          Dorsey attended the California Institute of the Arts in the School of Film & VideoSchool/Live Action. She received a full scholarship with her screenplays and short Super 8mm films. Dorsey was the only female in her freshman class and the youngest female to be admitted to the Live Action department up to that point. After completing three semesters she felt unsuited for the film industry and once again turned to a career in music.          At age 22, Dorsey moved to London to pursue her musical career, where she was in a musical collaboration/band 20To with keyboard player/composer Pete Stern. Their first demos were engineered and produced by Paul ""Doc"" Stewart at Village Way Studio in Rayners Lane, north west London. Stewart was responsible for their introduction to CBS records, which led to her first recording deal. She established herself through collaborations with artists such as Boy George, Ann Pigalle, and Donny Osmond. Dorsey's first high profile job was as a guest vocalist in the original line up of The Charlie Watts Big Band (drummer for The Rolling Stones) and its 1985 premiere at London's famous West End jazz club, Ronnie Scott's. A crucial point for Dorsey’s burgeoning solo career was her appearance on ""The Tube"", a hit British music television weekly hosted by Jools Holland and Paula Yates.          In December 1987, she signed with Warner Music Group in London, and in 1988 released her first solo album, ""The Corporate World"". The album was produced by bassist Nathan East of the jazz quartet Fourplay and included appearances by artists such as Eric Clapton. It received a 5-star review and was voted one of the Top 50 Albums of the Year by London's Q Magazine.          She moved to Island Records in 1991, signed by founder Chris Blackwell. In 1992, she released her second solo album entitled ""Rude Blue"", which featured trumpeter Mark Pender and trombonist Richie ""La Bamba"" (Conan O'Brien Band), Carla Azar on drums (Wendy & Lisa), Carol Steele on percussion (Bette Midler), and the infamous James Brown horn section of Maceo Parker, Fred Wesley, and Alfred ""Pee Wee"" Ellis. After almost 12 years in England, she relocated to the well-known artist community of Woodstock in upstate New York in 1994.          When her relationship with Island began to become strained, Dorsey began to concentrate on session work and in 1995 was recruited for David Bowie´s Outside Tour. Throughout the remainder of the 1990s and into the 21st century she performed and recorded with artists such as Gang Of Four, Louise Goffin, world music stars Rachid Taha, Faudel, and Khaled (""1, 2, 3 Soleils""), Sophie B. Hawkins, Tears For Fears, The The, The Indigo Girls, Canadian artist Jane Siberry, Jeffrey Gaines, Italian blues man Zucchero, Dar Williams, Catie Curtis, Toshi Reagon, Joan Osborne, The B-52s, and Michael Hutchence of INXS.          Gail Ann Dorsey is best known for her contribution to the David Bowie band. After the Outside Tour she provided vocals and bass for ""Earthling"" (1997), ""Heathen"" (2002), ""Reality"" (2003) and ""The Next Day"" (2013). She recorded ""Planet of Dreams"", a duet with Bowie on the 1997 EMI UK benefit CD release,"" Long Live Tibet"", as well as several other live recordings and videos. She has been on board for the last six tours and performed with David Bowie at ""The Concert For New York"" at Madison Square Garden. About a decade after ""Rude Blue"", Gail Ann Dorsey released her third solo album in 2003. The album entitled ""I Used To Be"" is a collection of previously unreleased material spanning the past 18 years of Dorsey's songwriting archives. She writes all songs with the exception of a few collaborators, namely Roland Orzabal and singer-songwriter Kristen Hall."" I Used To Be"" was produced by Dorsey and engineer/producer Brandon Mason (Joan Baez, Heather Nova), with long-time friend and fellow bassist, Sara Lee as executive producer.          Dorsey's musical style spans broadly and includes rock, funk, country, and pop influences. She describes her current sound as a present-day version of the AM/FM radio tunes that left a mark on her music such as The Fifth Dimension, Olivia Newton-John, Bread and the Wilson sisters, and Heart. When asked to describe her sound in one word she says ""Black-arach...but that's maybe how I feel most days. Sometimes you can never tell what vehicle is required to deliver the message until it tells you. I don't want to limit myself to anything. I just want to maintain honesty and substance in the work. That is my responsibility to the music and the audience.""

2017032,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2017032,Hong Kong Federation of Students,"The Hong Kong Federation of Students (, HKFS) is a student organisation formed by the student unions of four higher institutions in Hong Kong. The purpose of the HKFS is to promote student movements and to enhance students’ engagement in society.          It is currently led by Nathan Law Kwun-chung, the secretary-general of the federation.          The Council (代表會) is formed by the representatives from the student unions of the universities who are elected by university students. The standing committee is appointed by the Council.          The federation was founded in May 1958. Their purpose at that time was to promote students' participation in social affairs by representing students. There were originally four member university student unions, in its first term, the committee was made up of seven students.          In the Senkaku Islands dispute, at the time of the transfer of the administration of the Senkaku/Diaoyutai Islands from the United States to Japan in 1971, some Hong Kong students established the Hong Kong Action Committee in Defence of Diaoyutai Islands (香港保衛釣魚台行動委員會) on 14 February. The committee held demonstrations in front of the Japanese consulate in Hong Kong this led to twenty-one people being arrested, seven of whom were university students. On 17 April, the Hong Kong University Students' Union held a peaceful demonstration in which about 1,000 students took part however on 7 July, the federation held a larger-scale demonstration. As the federation was still an illegal organization at that time, some students were arrested by the Royal Hong Kong Police. On 13 May 1975, the federation held its last protest on the issue.          During 1975 to 1976, the standing committee of the federation voiced their support of the Cultural Revolution instigated by the Communist Party in mainland China. Mak Chung Man, who led students to protest against the communists, was criticised by the federation as being ""against all the Chinese"", this pronouncement caused great resentment among students, and the handling of diverging opinions became the main topic in the 1976 HKFS election.          In April 1977, the Hong Kong University Students' Union suggested removal of ""anti-right wing"" from the action guide of the federation but the standing committee refused to vote. All delegates from the Hong Kong University Students' Union withdrew in protest.          In April 1979, the federation held a memorial of May Fourth Movement, which was poorly attended.          During the 1980s, the federation started to support the democratic movements in Taiwan and mainland China.          In 1981 the ""Hong Kong Standard"" revealed that the HKFS had been on a 'Red List' in a classified Standing Committee on Pressure Groups (SCOPG) report, the report described the group as ""pro-communist"".          The federation reported Shue Yan College to the Independent Commission Against Corruption in March 1983 for serious corruption, however, ICAC chose not to prosecute the college.          After 1984, the federation fully changed its direction from supporting communism to supporting democratic development.          In February 1989, about 4,000 students boycotted classes to protest against the policy of the Education Department.          During the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the federation took part in the demonstrations and the strike in China. On 20 May, when the tropical cyclone signal number 8 was hoisted, thousands of students took part in a massive demonstration. After the 4 June massacre, all universities' students stopped attending classes, since then, there are memorial activities every year. In 1991, there were protests to support Wang Dan; however, the police said it was an ""illegal protest"" and gave warnings to the committees, this angered the students.          Since the 1990s, the federation has taken an interest in daily events in Hong Kong, and no longer restricts itself to the areas of education and politics.          In 2003, 2004 and 2005, the federation actively took part in the 1 July marches. In the one in 2004, the federation was the largest group present.          The federation, led by Alex Chow and Lester Shum, was a participating organisation of the Umbrella Movement in 2014, which demanded genuine democracy in future chief executive elections. Admiralty, Causeway Bay and Mong Kok were occupied by suffragists for two months.          Some democratic activists criticised the federation for failing to lead the movement. Five of its member organisations held disaffiliation referenda in early 2015, and four passed, reducing the number of member organisations from eight to four. The results are as follows:          Amidst the rise of localism of Hong Kong in 2015, the Federation was absent for the first time from the Victoria Park candlelight vigil commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre.

He is considered one of the elder statesmen of Australian literature. He is also known for short story collections and his autobiography ""Disturbing Element"".          Herbert was born Alfred Jackson in Geraldton, Western Australia, in 1901, the illegitimate son of Amy Victoria Scammell and Benjamin Francis Herbert, a Welsh-born engine driver. He was registered at birth as Alfred Jackson, son of John Jackson, auctioneer, with whom his mother had already had two children. Before writing he worked many jobs in Western Australia and Victoria; his first job was in a pharmacy at the age of fourteen. He studied pharmacy at Perth Technical College and was registered as a pharmacist on 21 May 1923 as Alfred Xavier Herbert. He moved to Melbourne, and in 1935 enrolled at the University of Melbourne to study medicine. He started his writing career writing short stories for the popular magazine and newspaper market, publishing under a range of pseudonyms, the most common being Herbert Astor.          He did not publish his first book, ""Capricornia"", until 1938. ""Capricornia"" was in part based on Herbert's experiences as Protector of Aborigines in Darwin, though it was written in London between 1930 and 1932. It won the Australian Literature Society Gold Medal for Australia's Best Novel of 1939.          The 1940s and 1950s were a relatively lean time for Herbert in terms of publication. He released ""Seven Emus"" (1959). In the 1960s he published two books, before the release of ""Poor Fellow My Country"" (1975), as well as a short story collection. ""Poor Fellow My Country"" is the longest Australian novel.          Herbert was well known for his outspoken views on indigenous issues. He was a great champion of Aboriginal peoples, particularly those living in missions in Queensland and the Northern Territory. In his personal life he was considered difficult, and his wife Sadie said it was a choice between having children and looking after Xavier. Aware of his own mythology, he frustrated biographers by telling unreliable stories about his life and past.          In 1977 the artist Ray Crooke painted a ""Portrait of Xavier Herbert"" followed in 1980 by a ""Portrait of Sadie Herbert"". Professor Emeritus Laurie Hergenhan discusses the story behind the creation of these artworks, and another portrait by Crooke of Sir Zelman Cowen, in ""A Tale of Three Portraits.""

1785944,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1785944,L'Illusion Comique,"L'Illusion comique is a comedic play written by Pierre Corneille in 1636. In its use of meta-theatricality (plays-within-the-play), it is far ahead of its time. It was first performed at the Hôtel de Bourgogne in 1636 and published in 1639.          Corneille wrote this piece at the age of 29 and had already written seven other plays. ""L'Illusion comique"" marks a turning point in his career. This piece can be regarded as the end of an apprenticeship during which the author demonstrates his literary prowess. In this work, Corneille makes use of all theatre genres: the first act is a prologue that is inspired by the pastoral style, and the next three acts are an imperfect comedy with the farcical character Matamore at the center. The fourth and fifth acts evolve into a tragicomedy with their episodes of rivalry, imprisonment, and even death. ""L'Illusion comique"" is therefore a summary of a theatrical universe, and it is in this play that Corneille shows his mastery of theatre as a whole.          ""L'Illusion comique"" plays with the idea of theatre within the theatre and has many layers of representation:          The complex structure of the play, based on a mise en abyme and a play on appearances is designed to confuse the reader. The game of illusions is found in the Baroque idea that life is a theatre; and Corneille exploits this idea by mixing the real life of Clindor and the role that he plays. Disguise and changing identity are marks of the Baroque in this play. The grotto can also be interpreted as a metaphor for the theatre and its spectators.          The linearity of the story is broken several times, and numerous digressions interrupt actions that overlap and are often incomplete. The principal story is interlaced with many subplots. The inconsistency of the plot is reinforced by the amorous inconsistency of the characters. This instability is present again at the end when Pridamant and the reader cannot distinguish between reality and fiction.          Corneille seems to disregard the three unities of classical theatre:          ""L'Illusion comique"" was written during a period of transition from the Baroque to the Classical, and it can be seen as both a homage to the Baroque theatre as well as a satire of the same.          Although this piece is primarily Baroque, certain passages seem to follow the traditional lines of classical tragedy. In spite of the legerity of the plot concerning the lovers, the theme of death appears several times. Of course, there is the false death of Clindor which plunges the play into the atmosphere of tragedy; like Pridamant, the spectator is faced with emotions of terror and pity which are the two great theatrical sentiments according to Aristotle. However, the two passages that are the most classical in nature are the monologues of Isabelle (Act IV, scene 1) and of Clindor (Act IV, scene 7. Devastated by the judgment against her lover, Isabelle imagines her own death like the heroine of a tragedy. Moreover, she is not satisfied to follow Clindor in death; she also hopes to punish her father. As for Clindor, he uses his memory of Isabelle in order to overcome his fear of death. He exclaims: ""I die glorious because I die for you!"" For a moment, he falls back into despair, but ultimately, love allows him to transcend his thoughts and fears of death.          The Commedia dell'arte is the principal source for the new theatre of the 17th century by bringing together a popular technique with the aesthetic development of the Renaissance in Italy. The Commedia dell'arte concerns itself mostly with the verbal and physical dexterity of the actors and relies heavily on improvisation. The character of Matamore is directly borrowed from this tradition as well as the juxtaposition of characters from several social classes. Matamore can be compared to Sganarelle, the valet of Don Juan.          Pastoral theatre takes place in an idealized setting according to the ancient model of Arcadia. The first act of ""L'Illusion comique"" borrows several elements from the pastoral, including the grotto and the magician.          A tragicomedy uses characters that are relatively close to everyday life who are confronted with situations where emotions get in the way of actions. The mixture of death (tragedy) and marriage (comedy) is one manifestation of this.          The play has enjoyed renewed popularity in recent years, since Tony Kushner adapted it as ""The Illusion"".          The Comédie Française commissioned an adaptation in modern dress from the actor/director Mathieu Amalric and that film débuted on French television in 2010. Among other changes, Matamore has become the designer of a shooter video game, while the final act takes place in a night club.          Ranjit Bolt's translation was dramatized and broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 25 September 2011 directed by Peter Kavanagh with original music composed and performed by Russell Taylor and Steve Cooke. The cast included: Richard Johnson as Alcandre, Michael Maloney as Clindor, John Sessions as Matamore, Hattie Morahan as Isabelle, Benjamin Whitrow as Géronte, Pip Torrens as Adraste, Rosie Fellner as Lyse, Paul Moriarty as Pridamant, Simon Bubb as Dorante and Victoria Inez-Hardy as Empress/Queen.          In 2012, a new adaptation of the play opened at Under St. Mark's in New York City. The production was adapted and directed by Kevin P. Joyce, and transposes the play from 17th century France to Turn-of-the-20th Century Louisiana, specifically the Atchafalaya Basin (Alcandre's lair), the Garden District (Isabelle's home) and a showboat (the Fifth Act). The role of Alcandre was rewritten for a woman and modeled after Marie Laveau. The production was directed by Mr. Joyce and featured Christopher Fayne as Pridamant, Rebeca Radozskowicz as Alcandre (understudied by Juanita Pearl Johnson), Matt Alford as Clindor, Alexandra Scardapane as Isabelle, Maisie Salinger as Lyse, Chris Lemieux as Matamore, Jesse Keitel as Adraste, Evan Pearson as Geronte, Andrew Meyer as Dorante/Jailer and Joshua Wise as the Page. It also featured music by PJ Rassmussen, designs by Justin West, Matsy Stintson, George Scholes Robson V, Vincent Coviello & Brian McManimon, as well as fight choreography by Brian Walters. The production received positive reviews from audiences but no reviews were publicly published due to the play's limited run.","['French plays', '1636 plays', 'Plays by Pierre Corneille']"

45223847,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45223847,List of schools and lineages of Tibetan Buddhism,"This is a list of schools and lineages of Tibetan Buddhism. It includes monastic and ngagpa lineages. It includes lineages that are entirely non-Tibetan in their current teaching membership, but which are derived from Tibetan Buddhism.          The diagram to the right shows the growth of Tibetan Buddhist traditions. The four main ones overlap markedly, such that ""about eighty percent or more of the features of the Tibetan schools are the same"". Differences include the use of apparently, but not actually, contradictory terminology, opening dedications of texts to different deities and whether phenomena are described from the viewpoint of an unenlightened practitioner or of a Buddha. On questions of philosophy they have no fundamental differences, according to the Fourteenth Dalai Lama The Tibetan adjectival suffix ""-pa"" is translatable as ""-ist"" in English.          These first four major schools are sometimes said to constitute the Nyingma ""Old Translation"" and Sarma ""New Translation"" traditions, the latter following from the historical Kadam lineage of translations and tantric lineages. Another common but trivial differentiation is into the Yellow Hat (Gelug) and Red Hat (non-Gelug) sects, a division that mirrors the distinction between the schools involved in the Rimé movement versus the one that did not, the Gelug. The correspondences are as follows:          ""The Ancient Ones"" are the oldest Buddhist school, the original order founded by Padmasambhava and Śāntarakṣita. Whereas other schools categorize their teachings into the three yānas or ""vehicles"", Hinayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana, the Nyingma tradition classifies its teachings into Nine Yānas, among the highest of which is Dzogchen. Terma ""treasures"" (revealed texts) are of particular significance to the Nyingma school.          “Lineage of the (Buddha's) Word”. This is an oral tradition which is very much concerned with the experiential dimension of meditation. Its most famous exponent was Milarepa, an 11th-century mystic. It contains one major and one minor subsect. The first, the Dagpo Kagyu, encompasses those Kagyu schools that trace back to the Indian master Naropa via Marpa Lotsawa, Milarepa and Gampopa and consists of four major sub-sects: the Karma Kagyu, headed by a Karmapa, the Tsalpa Kagyu, the Barom Kagyu, and Pagtru Kagyu. There are a further eight minor sub-sects, all of which trace their root to Pagtru Kagyu and the most notable of which are the Drikung and Drukpa Lineages. The once-obscure Shangpa Kagyu, which was famously represented by the 20th century teacher Kalu Rinpoche, traces its history back to the Indian master Naropa via Niguma, Sukhasiddhi and Kyungpo Naljor.          The ""Grey Earth"" school represents the scholarly tradition. Headed by the Sakya Trizin, this tradition was founded by Khön Könchok Gyelpo (, 1034–1102), a disciple of the great lotsāwa Drogmi Shākya () and traces its lineage to the mahasiddha Virūpa. A renowned exponent, Sakya Pandita (1182–1251CE), was the great-grandson of Khön Könchok Gyelpo.          The ""Way of Virtue"" school was originally a reformist movement and is known for its emphasis on logic and debate. The order was founded in the 14th to 15th century by Je Tsongkhapa, renowned for both his scholarship and virtue. Its spiritual head is the Ganden Tripa and its temporal one the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama is regarded as the embodiment of Avalokiteśvara. Successive Dalai Lamas ruled Tibet from the mid-17th to mid-20th centuries.           The Jonang is a minor school that branched off from Sakya traditions; it was suppressed in 1650 in Gelug-controlled regions and subsequently banned and its monks and nuns converted to the Gelug school in 1658.          The Jonang re-established their religio-political center in Golok, Nakhi and Mongol areas in Kham and Amdo centered at Dzamthang Monastery and have continued practicing uninterrupted to this day. An estimated 5,000 monks and nuns of the Jonang tradition practice today in these areas and at the edges of historic Gelug influence.          However, their teachings were limited to these regions until the Rimé movement of the 19th century encouraged the study of non-Gelug schools of thought and practice. In modern times has been encouraged to grow by the 14th Dalai Lama, who installed the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu as its head.",[]

23559098,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23559098,Murray Battery,"Murray Battery () was an artillery battery located on Battery Path, beneath Government Hill in Central, Hong Kong. Named after Sir George Murray, it was built in 1841, shortly after the British took possession of Hong Kong, and served to protect the colonial government's headquarters. It was demolished in the 1950s and replaced with the Former Central Government Offices.          During the First Opium War, the British occupied Hong Kong in 1841 and one year later, the territory was ceded to them in the Treaty of Nanking. The new administration chose the site around Battery Path to build its headquarters and defences. The coastal fortification consisted of five coastal artillery positions that overlooked and guarded Victoria Harbour in 1882 (however, due to land reclamation, the site is no longer situated on the coastline). These were removed in the late 19th century, due to the military's relocation and development of artillery batteries in more obscure and outlying areas in Hong Kong Island—namely the Lei Yue Mun Fort built in 1887. Prior to 1856, Murray Battery also marked the limits of the city's street lighting; all roads east of the battery were not illuminated.          However, the site of the battery still existed until the 1950s, when the colonial government decided to redevelop the area in order to build a new headquarters building that would consolidate all government departments in one place. As a result, the battery was demolished and the new (now former) Central Government Offices (CGO) was built in its place, with construction being completed in 1959. The West Wing of the CGO now occupies the site of the battery. Today, a replica cannon located near the CGO pays tribute to Murray's Battery.","['Former buildings and structures in Hong Kong', 'Forts in Hong Kong', 'Military of Hong Kong under British rule', 'Batteries']"

30944099,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30944099,Funmate,"Funmate (also called Funmate International) was a toy company based in Japan. It was probably best known for its plastic promotional model cars made in the 1970s and 1980s. Sizes varied, but they were about 1:40 scale (four to five inches in length). The company also made a variety of other plastic toys. Later toys were made in Hong Kong.          Probably Funmate's most well-known offering was a series of Ford vehicles sealed in plastic to the sides of Procter & Gamble detergent packages for 1971 and 1972 (The Accelerator, 2008). They were marketed as ""Go Cars"" and had a spring-loaded handle with a three-inch-long narrow metal rod that slipped into a hole in the back of the car. When not in use, the handle could be placed in another hole to the back right of the bumper. The handle was usually molded in the same color as the car. The car shot across the floor when a small black lever was depressed. Some of the later cars were made with a launching ""pad"" mechanism that the car rested on top of, probably because kids could get jabbed in the eye if the original rod wasn't held firmly. It could spring backwards as the original label on the bottom of the car warned.          These cars were produced in about 1:40 scale (5 inches long) and included Ford Torinos (in 1971 and 1972 body styles), a Ford Mustang Mach 1, a Maverick, a Thunderbird, a Mercury Cougar, and a Mercury Montego. They were molded in polystyrene plastic and came in light lime green, orange, yellow, beige, white and a dark maroon red. They appeared almost to be smaller versions of American promotional models, though the orange and maroon colors of plastic were not so opaque in appearance like in traditional 1:25 scale promotional models. Curiously, no dark greens or blues were offered. The cars had very accurate proportions and fair detail. Chassis were molded in a silver gray as were wheels. Tires were a hard black plastic. Because of the launching mechanism there were no interiors.           In Japan, these were sometimes packaged in non-promotional form as ""OK Star"" in a two tier carton that portrayed a driver with racing helmet on. These opened for display with Japanese script printed on the box. The packaging also had illustrations displaying how to use the launchers (71-73 Mustang).          A few General Motors cars in this same style were also offered. One was a 1971 Oldsmobile Omega two-door (the same general style as the Chevrolet Nova). The car came in red molded plastic with the typical Funmate gray base.          Funmate also offered other sizes of cars and other vehicles, almost always in plastic. Some were more sporty or collectible while others were commercial trucks and other vehicles. One example was a replica of a 1972 Lotus Formula One car. This car was also very similar to one made by a company named Jimson Toys. Many, but not all, of these cars had some kind of spring launch platform or ""key"" handle. A similar model looked a bit more like an Indy car, and also a series of closed vehicles that were called ""Grand Prix Racers"" were made and advertised as good for ""140 mph scale speed"".          Friction Volkswagen Beetles and Porsches and different kinds of trucks also appeared in about the same sizes. Some of the truck offerings, among them a cement mixer, a tow truck, a log hauling truck, a forklift and a dump truck. These were about the same length as the cars discussed above.          In the early 1980s, the company made a series of ""puffy stickers"" of NHL players, such as Wayne Gretzky, which could be peeled from a backing and stuck on other surfaces. Also an Apollo space command set of the moon voyage ships was offered. Toy pistols and rifles (some with scopes) were also produced. More recently, Funmate has focused on toys for young children and infants such as rattles, mobiles, dolls, and musical toys.          The Accelerator. 2008. From the Pony Toy Box.

Bolger was born in Celbridge, County Kildare, Ireland, and was Leicester City's academy Player of the Year in 2009.          He made his debut in the Football League, while on loan at Bristol Rovers, when he came on as a 78th-minute substitute for Carl Regan in a 6–1 defeat to Walsall on 29 January 2011. He scored an own goal against Brighton and Hove Albion on 5 February 2011 in a 2–4 defeat for Rovers, this defeat left Rovers 23rd in the league one point above Dagenham and Redbridge. In his 4th game for the club against Rochdale on 8 February 2011 he was sent off for the first time in his senior career after a second yellow card for a poor challenge on Chris O'Grady. Bolger's first win with the club came on his 6th appearance against Tranmere Rovers on 8 March 2011. Bolger played the full 90 minutes in the 1–0 victory.

43021655,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43021655,Illinois Compiled Statutes,"The Illinois Compiled Statutes (ILCS) are the codified statutes of a general and permanent nature of Illinois. The compilation organizes the general Acts of Illinois into 67 chapters arranged within 9 major topic areas. The Illinois Legislative Reference Bureau (LRB) makes additions, deletions, and changes to ILCS (for example, when new acts become law or existing acts are repealed) by filing documents as provided in Public Act 87-1005.          The compilation is an official compilation by the state and is entirely in the public domain for purposes of federal copyright law; anyone may publish the statutes. There is no official version of the ILCS, but there are several unofficial versions: Illinois State Bar Association's/West's ""Illinois Compiled Statutes"", West's ""Smith–Hurd Illinois Compiled Statutes Annotated"", and LexisNexis's ""Illinois Compiled Statutes Annotated"".          Illinois officially revised its laws in 1827-29, 1833, 1845, and 1874. In those revisions, bills were passed arranging the laws as alphabetical chapters. (The 1819 session laws can also be considered a revision of the laws in some respects.) Over time, the alphabetical arrangement of the 1874 Illinois Revised Statutes became less useful as some chapters had become huge, unwieldy, and disorganized by the addition of new acts. The Illinois Supreme Court, among others, had pointed out the confusion caused by the poor organization of the outdated Illinois Revised Statutes, and in its 1988 and 1989 annual reports to the General Assembly recommended consideration of recodification.          The 1874 Illinois Revised Statutes were an official arrangement of the statutes by the state in Illinois, but the state did not maintain the organizational scheme. When a new act became law and needed to be placed within the framework of the Illinois Revised Statutes, that task was left to private publishers, but the publishers were not consistent. One publisher might place a new act in one chapter and another publisher place the same new act in another chapter, and even if two publishers placed the act in the same chapter, they each might assign different paragraph numbers. To solve the confusion and decrease the expense to its members, the Illinois State Bar Association decided in the 1930s to endorse the edition of a single publisher and to encourage all of its members to use only that edition. The Bar Association's endorsement solved those problems, but it created another problem: a single publisher making editorial decisions as to where to place new acts in the chapters of the Illinois Revised Statutes allowed that publisher to assert a copyright interest in the arrangement of the Illinois Revised Statutes and to effectively prevent other publishers from entering the market. That publisher was West Publishing Company. Moreover, because the state had not maintained the organization and numbering of the Illinois Revised Statutes, it was an unofficial compilation of the statutes.          In the late 1980s, a dispute arose between West, which claimed a copyright interest, and Mead Data Central (then the owner of the LexisNexis research services), which wanted to publish the Illinois Revised Statutes. The dispute spilled over into the General Assembly and became a heavily lobbied issue, and as a result, in 1987 the General Assembly passed House Bill 1924, which attempted to make the arrangement of the Illinois Revised Statutes official and to put the arrangement into the public domain for purposes of federal copyright law. Governor James Thompson vetoed the bill, stating that he feared it would embroil the state in costly copyright litigation. In 1988, the General Assembly passed House Bill 3896, which had the same provisions as House Bill 1924, and the Governor again vetoed the bill. West and Mead later settled their dispute.          In 1989 the General Assembly passed House Bill 757, which became Public Act 86-523. That act directed the LRB to submit to the General Assembly a plan for the comprehensive and systematic codification of the statutory law. A Preliminary Plan dated November 29, 1990 was submitted. LRB received numerous suggestions from government officials and agencies, bar associations and other private organizations, publishers, and others, and in light of those suggestions, LRB submitted a Revised Plan dated October 22, 1991. The Revised Plan suggested organizing the nearly 2,000 acts into 67 chapters arranged within 9 major topic areas. The Board of the Legislative Reference Bureau held a public hearing on November 6, 1991 concerning the Preliminary and Revised Plans, and those testifying at the hearing generally expressed strong support.          In June 1992 the General Assembly passed House Bill 3810, which became Public Act 87-1005, which directed LRB to file a compilation of the general Acts of Illinois. The compilation was filed by LRB, as directed by Public Act 87-1005, on September 14, 1992. (Alternative sources give the effective date as September 3, 1992.) The compilation is known as the Illinois Compiled Statutes, or ILCS, and took effect January 1, 1993.          The previous official reorganizations of the statutes were also revisions in which new acts were passed that superseded existing acts. Those new acts contained changes to the law that were deemed appropriate. In contrast, the compilation under Public Act 87-1005 was solely a reorganization; it did not make changes to the text of the law. The many problems that arose in the course of the 1874 revision, described in pages 25 through 35 of Statutory Revision in Illinois, might have paled in comparison to the difficulties that would have arisen in an attempt to revise nearly 2,000 acts.","['Illinois law', 'United States state legal codes']"

21437222,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21437222,Poincaré plot,"A Poincaré plot, named after Henri Poincaré, is used to quantify self-similarity in processes, usually periodic functions. It is also known as a return map. Poincaré plots can be used to distinguish chaos from randomness by embedding a data set into a higher-dimensional state space.          Given a time series of the form          a return map in its simplest form first plots (""x"", ""x""), then plots (""x"", ""x""), then (""x"", ""x""), and so on.          An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a tracing of the voltage changes in the chest generated by the heart, whose contraction in the normal person is triggered by an electrical impulse that originates from its ""pacemaker"", the sinoatrial node. The ECG normally consists of a series of waves, labeled the P, Q, R, S and T waves. The P wave is due to the depolarization of the atria, the Q-R-S series of waves due to depolarization of the ventricles, and the T wave due to the repolarization (the opposite of depolarization) of the ventricles. The interval between two successive R waves (the RR interval) is a measure of the heart rate.          The heart rate normally varies slightly: during a deep breath, it speeds up and during a deep exhalation, it slows down. (The RR interval will shorten when the heart speeds up, and lengthen when it slows.) An RR tachograph is a graph of the numerical value of the RR-interval (measured heartbeat-to-heartbeat) versus time.           In the context of RR tachography, a Poincare plot (which is a special case of a recurrence plot) is a graph of RR(""n"") on the ""x""-axis versus RR(""n"" + 1) - i.e., the succeeding RR interval - on the ""y""-axis. That is, one takes takes a sequence of intervals and plots each interval against the following interval.          The recurrence plot is used as a standard visualizing technique to detect the presence of oscillations in non-linear dynamic systems. In the context of electrocardiography, the rate of the healthy heart is normally tightly controlled by the body's regulatory mechanisms (specifically, by the autonomic nervous system). An increase in the variability of heart rate suggests pathological conditions: it often increases after a myocardial infarction (""heart attack""), either because the sinoatrial node (pacemaker) is damaged, or because the damaged heart tissue produces abnormal electric current that cause the ventricles to beat prematurely or irregularly.","['Scaling symmetries', 'Dynamical systems', 'Chaos theory', 'Statistical charts and diagrams']"

37911732,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37911732,United States Motion Picture Corporation,"The United States Motion Picture Corporation was an early American independent film studio that produced comedic films on the East Coast. It existed during the ""transitional"" period before the Hollywood studio system centralized film production. The United States Motion Picture Corporation made one reel silent films in the Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, area from 1916 through 1919.          Incorporated in New Jersey on March 2, 1915, The United States Motion Picture Corporation established its main office in the Savoy Building in downtown Wilkes-Barre. Its studios were located across the Susquehanna River in Forty Fort, Pennsylvania, on Slocum Street near Wyoming Avenue. The company's studio, established in Forty Fort by the summer of 1915, was a glass and steel building that looked somewhat like a greenhouse, designed to allow maximum light for filming          The United States Motion Picture Corporation was founded by James O. Walsh, who was its president, Fred W. Hermann, who was the vice president, and Daniel L. Hart, who was its treasurer and is also listed as its scenario editor in one newspaper account. Hart, an award-winning playwright, would later serve as the mayor of Wilkes-Barre from 1920 to his death in 1933.           Between October 2, 1916 and November 12, 1917, the United States Motion Picture Corporation produced and released twenty-seven Black Diamond Comedies. ""Black Diamond"" referred to anthracite coal, deposits of which had made Wilkes-Barre and the surrounding area a center of the mining industry and contributed to the region's wealth. The one-reel silent films were the first comedies distributed by Paramount Pictures, which was then based in New York. Paramount advertised these comedies widely in 1917, sometimes alongside those of Fatty Arbuckle, another Paramount comic artist. The films often followed a comic character named Susie, portrayed by USMPC’s leading lady Leatrice Joy, through mishaps and blunders. The films' advertisements that appear in ""The Moving Picture World"" magazine note the use of comic special effects with stop action and film speed experimentation.          After the company ended its contract with Paramount Pictures in 1917, USMPC released six additional one-reel comic films as Unique Comedies, which were distributed by the Arrow Film Company of New York. These include ""His Neglected Wife,"" which also stars Leatrice Joy and other actors who appeared in Black Diamond Comedies.          The United States Motion Picture Corporation also released Rainbow Comedies, one-reel comic films distributed by the General Film Company, in 1918 and 1919. These films often starred Lillian Vera and Eddie Boulden and were directed by Joseph A. Richmond.          The United States Motion Picture Corporation stopped producing films in 1919. The company's studios in Forty Fort, Pennsylvania were subsequently used by the Serico Company, which filmed its serial ""A Woman in Grey"" in 1920.          Three films produced by the United States Motion Picture Corporation are known to survive, the Black Diamond Comedies films ""Her Fractured Voice"" and ""Susie Slips One Over"", and the Unique Comedies film ""His Neglected Wife"".          The Prelinger Archives digitized its print of ""Her Fractured Voice"" and made it available online. The film features scenes of downtown Wilkes-Barre, including images of the original fountain in the city's Public Square.           Film prints of ""Susie Slips One Over"" are held at the UCLA Film and Television Archive. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ Margaret Herrick Library in Los Angeles also holds a poster for the film. In 2012, The UCLA Film and Television Archive deposited a DVD of the film with the Luzerne County Historical Society archive in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.           Only one print of the United States Motion Pictures Corporation films released under the Unique Comedies title is known to exist, ""His Neglected Wife"" starring Leatrice Joy. The film was discovered in a vault in New Zealand and was returned to the United States for restoration at George Eastman House in 2010. The film features images of the historic Hotel Sterling in Wllkes-Barre, which was torn down in 2013. Charles Petrillo, a historian in Wilkes-Barre, sponsored this restoration and has ensured that a DVD copy of the film will be placed at the Luzerne County Historical Society archives for further study.          On October 26, 2012, King's College and the Luzerne County Historical Society cosponsored a screening of the films ""Her Fractured Voice"", ""His Neglected Wife"", and ""Flesh and Spirit"".

876073,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=876073,John Kahn,"John Kahn (June 13, 1947 - May 30, 1996) was an American rock and roll bass guitarist. From 1970 to 1995, Kahn was Jerry Garcia's principal musical collaborator outside of the Grateful Dead.          John Kahn was born in Memphis, Tennessee. Adopted at birth by the Kahn family, he grew up in Beverly Hills, California. At Beverly Hills High School, he earned a reputation as a precocious musician playing jazz guitar and composing a symphonic piece, ""Western Impressions"", the first orchestral work by a student to be publicly performed by the school's orchestra under the direction of Robert Holmes.          In his junior year, Kahn switched to double bass and formed a jazz duo with a pianist, Peter Isackson, who encouraged him to study with Monty Budwig, a member of the house rhythm section at Shelly's Manne-hole. He moved to Sausalito, California in 1965, where he began to gravitate toward the incipient rock culture of the Haight-Ashbury district in nearby San Francisco. In 1967, he began working as a session musician with a litany of notable blues, folk, and rock performers, including Mike Bloomfield, Nick Gravenites, Mississippi Fred McDowell, John Lee Hooker, Brewer & Shipley (a longstanding collaboration that encompassed their 1971 Top Ten hit ""One Toke Over the Line""), Tom Fogerty, Maria Muldaur, Al Kooper, Jackie DeShannon, and Otis Rush.          Kahn first played with Garcia in May 1970 as the bassist of a jazz rock group that coalesced around Garcia and organist Howard Wales during Monday night jam sessions at The Matrix, a San Francisco nightclub of the era; this ensemble would go on to record ""Hooteroll?"" (1971; credited to Garcia and Wales). He also played acoustic bass in Old and in the Way, a bluegrass supergroup that toured in 1973 and 1974. Along with Kahn, the band featured Garcia on banjo and vocals, future progressive bluegrass luminary David Grisman on mandolin and vocals, Peter Rowan on guitar and vocals, and Vassar Clements on fiddle. From 1970 to 1975, Kahn played in the Merl Saunders and Jerry Garcia Band and was an integral part of later iterations of the Garcia/Saunders collaboration, including Legion of Mary (1974-1975) and Reconstruction (1978-1979); ironically, the latter group was initially intended to serve as a musical outlet for Kahn during Garcia's tours with the Grateful Dead. Kahn was the only founding member of the Jerry Garcia Band (1975-1995) to remain with the group until its dissolution following Garcia's death in 1995. He also played alongside Garcia in the Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band (1987-1988) and served as the guitarist's only accompanist in the Garcia & Kahn acoustic duo that toured intermittently from 1982 to 1989.          Kahn did occasional work for the Grateful Dead, serving as a recording engineer alongside Betty Cantor-Jackson and Bob Matthews for the band's aborted ""Egypt '78"" live album documenting performances at the Giza Plateau in September 1978; selections from these concerts were eventually released as """" (2008). He also contributed organ and additional production to ""Shakedown Street"" (1978) following the departure of nominal producer Lowell George.          He died of a heart attack in his sleep on May 30, 1996.","['1947 births', '1996 deaths', 'People from Memphis, Tennessee', 'American rock bass guitarists', 'American Jews', 'Jerry Garcia', '20th-century American musicians']"
46743913,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46743913,Guryong Village,"Guryong or Guryong Village () is an illegal encampment (commonly called a slum or a shantytown) on private land in Seoul, South Korea, on the edge of the affluent southside district of Dogok-dong, Gangnam District from which it is separated by a six-lane motorway.          It was first created in 1988 by people evicted from houses in other low-income areas demolished during the city's rapid development prior to the 1988 Olympic Games, and who came to this area as their last refuge. Since at least 2011, there have been plans for re-purposing the area and relocating the residents, though little progress has been made due to disagreements between officials on the best plan of action. Current government plans propose to demolish Guryong in 2015 and arrange subsidized housing for residents. It has an estimated 2,500 to 4,000 inhabitants (all numbers are estimates as no demographic survey of that area has ever been conducted), primarily impoverished elderly, living in between 1,200 and 2,000 shacks and trailers in a village area of about 286,929 square meters (about 70 acres). Individual houses have the size of about 16 to 99 square meters. The residents, who have established a postal service in their area, have received temporary residence cards in 2011. The village has buildings like kindergarten and church, utilities like water, gas and electricity, for which payments are communal; and its own security, all organized through two village associations.          Due to unsafe construction, the village has been affected by a number of fire accidents.          It has been called ""the last slum in Seoul's glitzy Gangnam district"" and ""the last shanty town in Gangnam"" and, broader, ""the last remaining urban slum in Seoul"".","['Neighbourhoods of Seoul', 'Slums in Asia', 'Shanty towns in Asia', '1988 establishments in South Korea']"

26476627,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26476627,Future Husband,"""Future Husband"" is the of the fourth season of the American television comedy series ""30 Rock"". It was directed by series producer Don Scardino, and written by Jon Haller and Tracey Wigfield. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on March 11, 2010. Elizabeth Banks, James Rebhorn, and Michael Sheen guest star in the episode, and there are cameo appearances by Jack Welch and Brian Williams.          In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) finds a mysterious number in her phone under the name ""Future Husband."" At the same time, Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for General Electric (GE), Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) is informed that a cable company is rumored to buy out NBC. Elsewhere, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) stages a one-man show in an attempt to win a Tony Award, as part of his EGOT quest. The episode makes reference to the real-life acquisition of NBC Universal by the cable company network Comcast.          ""Future Husband"" received generally mixed reviews from television critics. According to the Nielsen ratings, the episode was watched by 5.894 million households during its original broadcast, and received a 2.9 rating/8 share among viewers in the 18–49 demographic.          Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) comes across an unrecognized contact in her cellphone listed as ""future husband"", and realizes that it must be a man she met at her dental appointment with Dr. Kaplan (James Rebhorn), while awakening from anesthesia in the recovery room after root canal surgery (seen in the previous episode). She calls the number, pretends to be the Jamaican dental receptionist, and asks the man to come back to see Dr. Kaplan. At the appointed time, she returns to the dentist's office, but does not recognize anyone there; so she calls the number again. When the man (Michael Sheen) answers, she sees him and hangs up. Unbeknownst to Liz, her number is already listed in his cellphone under ""future wife"". He calls her back upon seeing she called, and they arrange a date; she learns that his name is Wesley. On their date, the two fail to hit it off: they find each other annoying and share many flaws but few interests. Later, at the 30 Rock studios, Liz discovers that Wesley was the person who retrieved NBC page Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) wallet, after Kenneth threw it out of a window earlier. Because of this coincidence, Liz and Wesley decide to go on another date.          At the same time, Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) aspirations of becoming CEO of General Electric (GE) comes to a halt when his girlfriend and CNBC host, Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) informs him that the Philadelphia-based cable company Kabletown is rumored to be buying NBC. Jack—who serves as Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for GE—insists that no sale is pending, as he believes that his mentor and GE CEO Don Geiss (Rip Torn) would not agree to such a deal. As rumors persist, Jack panics, but things get worse when he learns from former GE chairman Jack Welch (as himself) that Don Geiss has been dead for weeks and that the company negotiated a takeover with Kabletown. Welch kept Geiss's death a secret while negotiations took place. Liz comforts Jack when he admits his dream of running GE is crushed. The next day, on Avery Jessup's program, ""The Hot Box"", Jessup confirms that the buyout has gone forward, praising Jack Donaghy as a wise choice to lead Kabletown's new acquisition. Jack, who is watching the program, is cheered by this.          Elsewhere, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) performs a one-man show on Broadway so that he can be considered for a Tony Award as part of his EGOT quest. His show receives positive reviews, and Tracy is convinced that he will win a Tony, but Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) tells him that in order for him to qualify for the award he must do his one-man show eight times, which worries Tracy, as he is unable to perform anything the same way twice. Despite initial reluctance to help him, Jenna eventually agrees to coach Tracy in the principles of acting, but this leads nowhere, resulting in the two arguing and Jenna telling him he can go on his show and read the phone book for all she cares. At the end of the episode, Tracy does read the phone book at his show, making Jenna very proud of him, and inexplicably drawing high praise from the audience.          ""Future Husband"" was directed by series producer Don Scardino, and was written by Jon Haller and Tracey Wigfield. This was Haller's first penned script, and was Wigfield's second writing credit, having co-written ""Jackie Jormp-Jomp"" for the show's third season. ""Future Husband"" originally aired in the United States on March 11, 2010, on NBC as the of the fourth season. This episode of ""30 Rock"" was filmed on December 17, 2009.          In December 2009, it was confirmed that actress Elizabeth Banks would guest star on the show, and in this episode, she played right-wing CNBC anchor Avery Jessup, and love interest to the Jack Donaghy character, played by Alec Baldwin. In an interview with ""Entertainment Weekly"", Banks revealed that she approached the ""30 Rock"" staff about making an appearance as she is a fan of the show. ""I definitely put feelers out, like, 'I would love to be on your show.' And they did it. They made it happen! I'm a huge fan, so this is a dream come true."" She also revealed that she had no intention on becoming a series regular, explaining that she has been having ""too much fun"" making movies to commit to a television show full-time. Banks made her debut as Avery Jessup in the previous episode ""Anna Howard Shaw Day"". In January 2010, it was announced that actor Michael Sheen would guest star as a love interest for Liz Lemon, played by series creator Tina Fey. In this episode, he made his debut as the character Wesley. Liz and Wesley's story arc continued in the episodes ""Don Geiss, America and Hope"", ""Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land"", and ""I Do Do"".          In ""Future Husband"", Jack learns from former GE chairman Jack Welch that current GE CEO Don Geiss, played by Rip Torn, has died. Torn did not make any appearances in this season, marking his last role as Don Geiss in the episode ""Larry King"" that aired on February 26, 2009, during the third season. Television writer Bob Sassone of TV Squad wondered if Torn was written out of the series due to an alcohol-related incident that occurred to Torn in January 2010. Welch appeared as himself here and was chairman and CEO of GE from 1981 until 2001. Actor James Rebhorn, best known for his current role as a special agent in the USA Network crime comedy-drama ""White Collar"", made his debut as the character Dr. Kaplan, Liz and Wesley's dentist. This was news anchor Brian Williams' third guest appearance as himself. In the scene in which he appears, Williams engages in smack talk in the CNBC offices, telling Avery and her colleagues that his news program ""NBC Nightly News"" ""rules"".          The storyline in ""Future Husband"" involving the fictitious Philadelphia-based cable company Kabletown purchasing NBC is based on the acquisition of NBC Universal by Comcast in November 2009. After winning her fourth Screen Actors Guild Award as her television character at the 16th Screen Actors Guild Awards in January 2010, Fey was asked whether or not ""30 Rock"" would make reference to the Comcast acquisition to which she said that it would be dealt with. ""The sale of NBC to another company is integral to our show and it will be hard for Jack."" In April 2010, the NBC network created a website for Kabletown. When asked by a contributor from ""The Philadelphia Inquirer"" why the characters on ""30 Rock"" refer to the network's new owner as ""Kabletown, with a K"", co-showrunner and executive producer Robert Carlock revealed that the reason for this was that the staff writers came up with the name ""Cabletown"", however, they later learned that there was a real company with a similar name, so NBC's legal team department ""wanted to emphasize the difference, and after a while, everyone just liked the sound of it.""          This was the second time the series referenced the Tracy Jordan character trying to get his EGOT. This plot first began in the December 3, 2009, episode ""Dealbreakers Talk Show"" in which Tracy finds a diamond encrusted ""EGOT"" necklace and sets a new life goal to achieve EGOT status by winning four major awards: an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony. In the episode, Tracy performs a one-man show so that he can get a Tony Award.          In the beginning of this episode, Liz asks where Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) is, as he is one of her staff writers and she wants him to write some Winter Olympics sketches. This results in Liz breaking the fourth wall—a term used when a character in a television show, film or on stage directly addresses the audience—where she mouths speech that is unintelligible, while her voice is heard saying ""Lindsey Vonn!"" who won the ""gold medal for skiing!""          Kenneth references the 1987 thriller film ""Fatal Attraction"" after encouraging Liz to meet with her ""future husband"" and deeming it a romantic situation, saying ""Just like that movie I only saw the first 10 minutes of, ""Fatal Attraction""!"". The movie is about a married man who has a weekend affair with a woman who refuses to end the affair as she becomes obsessed with him. In addition, Jane Krakowski appeared in ""Fatal Attraction"". Kenneth later has a dream that seems to be influenced by the movie ""The Shining,"" telling Jenna, ""Late at night these two little twin girls told me they wanted to play with me forever."" He also references the story of Lot and his daughters from the Bible, and a vignette from ""Saved by the Bell"" involving characters Samuel ""Screech"" Powers and Lisa Turtle.          Wondering why he has not seen any of his GE colleagues, Jack's office assistant Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy) suggests that maybe they are the last people on Earth, as he references the 2007 film ""I Am Legend"", ""You're Will Smith and I'm the dog!"" In ""I Am Legend"", Will Smith's character is the last healthy human in New York City and lives with his dog. In order to figure out what is going on, Jonathan does investigative work and downloads Don Geiss's schedule while self-narrating to the theme music of """" (1996). After Kenneth convinces her to call her ""future husband"", Liz, who speaks in a Jamaican accent as Dr. Kaplan's dental assistants are Jamaican women, tells the man he needs to come into Dr. Kaplan's office for some work, and Liz ends the call with """"Cool Runnings"", man! Bobsled!"" This is a reference to the comedy movie ""Cool Runnings"" (1993) in which the Jamaica national bobsled team's made their debut the 1988 Winter Olympics. In another scene, Liz's ringtone is the song ""Fuck the Pain Away"" by Canadian electronic musician Peaches.          While giving elocution lessons to Tracy, Jenna quotes the song ""I Am So Proud"" from Gilbert and Sullivan's ""The Mikado"" when she asks him to repeat the phrase, ""To sit in solemn silence in a dull dark dock/Awaiting the sensation of a short, sharp, shock.""          In its original American broadcast, ""Future Husband"" was watched by 5.894 million households, according to the Nielsen ratings system. It received a 2.9 rating/8 share among viewers in the 18–49 demographic, meaning that 2.9 percent of all people in that group, and 8 percent of all people from that group watching television at the time, watched the episode. During its original broadcast, ""Future Husband"" ranked fourth in its 9:30 p.m. slot, behind CBS's crime drama """", ABC's medical series ""Grey's Anatomy"", and Fox's reality show ""Kitchen Nightmares"".          Leonard Pierce of ""The A.V. Club"" was not positive in his review, describing ""Future Husband"" as the ""laziest"" episode of the fourth season. Nonetheless, Pierce responded favorably to Tracy's one-man show, calling it the ""shortest and best of the plots"" and ""even manages to get a laugh out of that old 'I'd watch him reading the phone book' chestnut."" Sean Gandert for ""Paste"" magazine said in his recap that part of this episode was disappointing, writing that the main plot was not ""too awful, [it was] just comparatively dull."" Though, he was positive towards the show's interpretation of the NBC and Kabletown storyline, saying it was a nice ""little riff"" on the actual merger between NBC and Comcast. Gandert was appreciative to Elizabeth Banks' small part, and hoped to see her in future episodes. ""Entertainment Weekly"" contributor Margaret Lyons opined it was a ""strange"" episode of ""30 Rock"", and concluded ""It's not that 'Future Husband' was radically terrible or anything, but wow, that episode just did not click into place."" Bob Sassone of TV Squad did not enjoy Jenna's involvement in Tracy's story, and that overall he did not find their antics ""too funny"". Nonetheless, Sassone enjoyed Brian Williams' cameo.          IGN contributor Robert Canning wrote that the NBC/Comcast reference here ""wasn't exactly a well of laughs, but Baldwin's Donaghy kept the story entertaining enough to want to follow it."" He enjoyed Banks' appearance, noting that her standout moment came when Avery and Jack argued over the direction of NBC ""and for that brief moment Banks stole the show from Baldwin."" In conclusion, Canning gave it an 8 out of 10 rating. James Poniewozik of ""Time"" magazine said that the main story ""played more like a subplot even though it gave the episode its title"". He added that there were some fine moments, and that overall Liz and Jack's plots ""have the potential to give the show some interesting forward movement"". ""Los Angeles Times"" contributor Meredith Blake felt that Michael Sheen was ""underused"" in his role, and observed that Jack and Avery's relationship showcased here seemed ""remarkably convincing."" Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for ""The Star-Ledger"" wrote that the episode's storytelling was ""better than it's been in recent weeks"", however, was not complimentary towards Liz meeting Sheen's Wesley, as he felt that their plot fell flat.","['30 Rock (season 4) episodes', '2010 television episodes']"

37331091,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37331091,Comet (pinball),"Comet is a pinball machine released by Williams in June 1985. It was designed by Barry Oursler and was the first in a Rollercoaster/Carnival themed pinball trilogy followed by ""Cyclone"" in 1988 and ""Hurricane"" in 1991.          In this pinball game, the player attempts to navigate throughout a representation of a Carnival, with the namesake ""Comet"" being a central ramp representing a roller coaster, normally worth 10,000 points. Two banks of Shooting Gallery targets (""Rabbits"" and ""Ducks"") can be targeted to score points and advance the matching bonus counter. Each bonus track is worth a maximum of 63,000 points. Hitting all four targets in a target bank lights an additional objective, which allows you to collect the matching bonus during play by completing the Whirlwind ramp (for Ducks) or the Funhouse saucer (for Rabbits). Completing both target banks lights additional points for the center ramp (30,000, 50,000, 100,000, and one more 100,000 per sequential shot), including the chance for extra balls and replays depending on specific game settings. Completing the ramp advances both bonuses.          The most definitive feature of Comet is a ""Motorcycle Jump"" ramp on the upper-right side of the playfield. This features a Skee ball-like scoring setup, where the closest target is worth 20,000, the middle target is worth 50,000, and the farthest target is worth 200,000. Completing the ramp advances both bonuses. The ramp starts each ball in a lit state, then becomes unlit after being scored.          ""Comet"" features a relatively unique flipper area arrangement. On the right side, there is no inlane and on the left side, the inlane and outlane are inverted. What would normally be an inlane on a conventional pinball machine instead causes the ball to drain. The left inlane relights the Motorcycle Jump ramp, and the two outlanes advance the bonus.          Next to the central ""Comet"" ramp is a drop target that reveals the ""Dunk The Dummy"" target. Once the drop target is hit, the ""dummy"" will taunt the player using voice sounds (""Hey Turkey!"", ""Hit me, Turkey!""). Hitting the Dunk The Dummy target will increase the bonus multiplier by one step(2x, 3x, 5x).          At the top of the playfield is a set of four rollover targets that spell out ""1-9-8-6"". Completing these four targets will activate a playfield point multiplier for a limited time. By default this is a 2x multiplier, but is 3x on the second ball, and 5x on the final ball (i.e. ""2x, 3x, 5x"" in three-ball play and ""2x, 3x, 2x, 2x, 5x"" in five-ball play). ""Comet"" has the ability to cycle the already lit targets towards the right by activating the right flipper, using the ""Lane Change"" feature.          If the 5x playfield multiplier is lit at the same time as the Motorcycle Jump ramp is lit, a voice will announce ""One Million!"" and additional playfield lights will highlight the Motorcycle Jump ramp. Completing the longest jump at this time will award one million points (200,000 times 5x). ""Comet"" was the first solid-state machine to feature a one million point shot.","['Williams pinball machines', '1985 pinball machines']"

This site is home to one of Telefís Éireann's original five main television transmitters. Coming on air in December 1962, initially on low power, it was in full operation by September 1963 with a 625-line VHF service for the Southwest of Ireland, namely counties Cork, Kerry and Limerick. Today it is owned and operated by 2RN a subsidiary of RTÉ. In 2009 in preparation for the transmission of digital terrestrial television (DTT), a new mast was erected at Mullaghanish with a height of 225m, making it the tallest television transmitter in Ireland, the original 170m mast was subsequently removed. Analogue television transmissions from this site ended on 24 October 2012, and the national DTT service, Saorview, is now broadcast from Mullaghanish at an ERP of 200 kW, making this the most powerful television transmitter in all of Ireland, a distinction formerly attributed to the Cairn Hill (analogue) transmitter in County Longford.          As well as digital television, six national FM radio services are broadcast from the site, all using vertical polarisation. Local station, Radio Kerry, is broadcast from a directional antenna pointing west, into its target service area of County Kerry, and Newstalk is broadcast in mono.          The Mullaghanish transmitter also has the highest number of relays (20) of any television transmitter in Ireland reflecting the difficult topography of its service area.","['Radio masts and towers in Europe', 'Marilyns of Ireland', 'Hewitts of Ireland', 'Mountains and hills of County Kerry', 'Mountains and hills of County Cork', 'Radio in Ireland', 'Media in the Republic of Ireland', 'Transmitter sites in Ireland', 'Mountains under 1000 metres']"
16024,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16024,Justus von Liebig,"Justus Freiherr von Liebig (12 May 1803 – 18 April 1873) was a German chemist who made major contributions to agricultural and biological chemistry, and was considered the founder of organic chemistry. As a professor at the University of Giessen, he devised the modern laboratory-oriented teaching method, and for such innovations, he is regarded one of the greatest chemistry teachers of all time. He has been described as the ""father of the fertilizer industry"" for his emphasis on nitrogen and certain minerals as essential plant nutrients, and his formulation of the Law of the Minimum which described the effect of individual nutrients on crops. He also developed a manufacturing process for beef extracts, and founded a company, Liebig Extract of Meat Company, that later trademarked the Oxo brand beef bouillon cube.          Justus von Liebig was born in Darmstadt into the middle-class family of Johann Georg Liebig and Maria Caroline Möser in early May 1803. His father was a drysalter and hardware merchant who compounded and sold paints, varnishes and pigments, which he developed in his own workshop. From childhood Justus was fascinated with chemistry.          At the age of 13, Liebig lived through the year without a summer, when the majority of food-crops in the northern hemisphere were destroyed by a volcanic winter. Germany was among the hardest-hit in the global famine that ensued, and the experience is said to have shaped Liebig's later work. Thanks in part to Liebig's innovations in fertilizers and agriculture, the 1816 famine became known as ""the last great subsistence crisis in the Western world"".          Liebig attended grammar school at the Ludwig-Georgs-Gymnasium in Darmstadt, from the age of 8 to 14. Leaving without a certificate of completion, he was apprenticed for several months to the apothecary Gottfried Pirsch (1792–1870) in Heppenheim before returning home, possibly because his father could not afford to pay his indentures. He worked with his father for the next two years, then attended the University of Bonn, studying under Karl Wilhelm Gottlob Kastner, a business associate of his father. When Kastner moved to the University of Erlangen, Liebig followed him.          Liebig left Erlangen in March 1822, in part because of his involvement with the radical Korps Rhenania (a nationalist student organization) but also because of his hopes for more advanced chemical studies. The circumstances are clouded by possible scandal. In late 1822 Liebig went to study in Paris on a grant obtained for him by Kastner from the Hessian government. He worked in the private laboratory of Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, and was also befriended by Alexander von Humboldt and Georges Cuvier (1769–1832). Liebig's doctorate from Erlangen was conferred on 23 June 1823, a considerable time after he left, as a result of Kastner's intervention on his behalf. Kastner pleaded that the requirement of a dissertation be waived, and the degree granted ""in absentia"".          Liebig left Paris to return to Darmstadt in April 1824. On 26 May 1824 at the age of 21 and with Humboldt's recommendation, Liebig became a professor ""extraordinarius"" at the University of Giessen. Liebig's appointment was part of an attempt to modernize the University of Giessen and attract more students. He received a small stipend, without laboratory funding or access to facilities.          His situation was complicated by the presence of existing faculty: Professor Wilhelm Zimmermann (1780–1825) taught general chemistry as part of the philosophy faculty, leaving medical chemistry and pharmacy to Professor Philipp Vogt in the medical faculty. Vogt was happy to support a reorganization in which pharmacy was taught by Liebig and became the responsibility of the faculty of arts, rather than the faculty of medicine. Zimmermann found himself competing unsuccessfully with Liebig for students and their lecture fees. He refused to allow Liebig to use existing space and equipment, and finally committed suicide on 19 July 1825. The deaths of Zimmermann and a Professor Blumhof who taught technology and mining opened the way for Liebig to apply for a full professorship. Liebig was appointed to the ""ordentlicher"" chair in chemistry on 7 December 1825, receiving a considerably increased salary and a laboratory allowance.          Liebig married Henriette ""Jettchen"" Moldenhauer (1807–1881), the daughter of a state official, in May 1826. They had five children, Georg (1827–1903), Agnes (1828–1862), Hermann (1831–1894), Johanna (1836–1925) and Marie (1845–1920). Although Liebig was Lutheran and Jettchen Catholic, their differences in religion appear to have been resolved amicably by bringing their sons up in the Lutheran religion and their daughters as Catholics.          Liebig and several associates proposed to create an institute for pharmacy and manufacturing within the university. The Senate, however, uncompromisingly rejected their idea, stating that it was not the university's task to train ""apothecaries, soapmakers, beer-brewers, dyers and vinegar-distillers."" As of 17 December 1825, they ruled that any such institution would have to be a private venture. This decision actually worked to Liebig's advantage. As an independent venture, he could ignore university rules and accept both matriculated and non-matriculated students. Liebig's institute was widely advertised in pharmaceutical journals, and opened in 1826. Its classes in practical chemistry and laboratory procedures for chemical analysis were taught in addition to Liebig's formal courses at the university.          From 1825 to 1835, the laboratory was housed in the guardroom of a disused barracks on the edge of town. The main laboratory space was about 38 square metres, including a small lecture room, a storage closet, and a main room with ovens and work tables. An open colonnade outside could be used for dangerous reactions. Liebig could work there with 8 or 9 students at a time. He lived in a cramped apartment on the floor above with his wife and children.          Liebig was one of the first chemists to organize a laboratory in its present form, engaging with students in empirical research on a large scale through a combination of research and teaching. His methods of organic analysis enabled him to direct the analytical work of many graduate students. Liebig's students were from many of the German states as well as Britain and the United States, and they helped create an international reputation for their ""Doktorvater."" His laboratory became renowned as a model institution for the teaching of practical chemistry. It was also significant for its emphasis on applying discoveries in fundamental research to the development of specific chemical processes and products.          In 1833, Liebig was able to convince chancellor Justin von Linde to include the institute within the university. In 1839, he obtained government funds to build a lecture theatre and 2 separate laboratories, designed by architect Paul Hofmann. The new chemistry laboratory featured innovative glass-fronted fume cupboards and venting chimneys. By 1852, when he left Giessen for Munich, more than 700 students of chemistry and pharmacy had studied with Liebig.          A significant challenge facing nineteenth century organic chemists was the lack of instruments and methods of analysis to support accurate, replicable analyses of organic materials. Many chemists worked on the problem of organic analysis, including French Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Swedish Jöns Jacob Berzelius, before Liebig developed his version of an apparatus for determining the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen content of organic substances in 1830. It involved an ingenious array of five glass bulbs, called a ""Kaliapparat"" to trap oxidation products. Water was absorbed in a bulb of hygroscopic calcium chloride which was weighed to measure hydrogen. Carbon dioxide was absorbed in a potassium hydroxide solution in the three lower bulbs and used to measure carbon. Oxygen was calculated from the difference. A coal fire was used for combustion. Weighing carbon and hydrogen directly, rather than estimating them volumetrically, greatly increased the method's accuracy of measurement. Liebig's assistant Carl Ettling perfected glass-blowing techniques for producing the kaliapparat, and demonstrated them to visitors. Liebig's kaliapparat simplified the technique of quantitative organic analysis and rendered it routine. Brock suggests that the availability of a superior technical apparatus was one reason why Liebig was able to attract so many students to his laboratory. His method of combustion analysis was used pharmaceutically, and certainly made possible many contributions to organic, agricultural and biological chemistry.          Liebig also popularized use of a counter-current water-cooling system for distillation, still referred to as a Liebig condenser. Liebig himself attributed the vapor condensation device to German pharmacist Johann Friedrich August Gottling, who had made improvements in 1794 to a design discovered independently by German chemist Christian Ehrenfried Weigel in 1771, by French scientist, P. J. Poisonnier in 1779, and by Finnish chemist Johan Gadolin in 1791.          Although it was not widely adopted until after Liebig's death, when safety legislation finally prohibited the use of mercury in making mirrors, Liebig proposed a process for silvering that eventually became the basis of modern mirror-making. In 1835 he reported that aldehydes reduce silver salts to metallic silver. After working with other scientists, Carl August von Steinheil approached Liebig in 1856 to see if he could develop a silvering technique capable of producing high-quality optical mirrors for use in reflecting telescopes. Liebig was able to develop blemish-free mirrors by adding copper to ammoniated silver nitrate and sugar. An attempt to commercialize the process and ""drive out mercury mirror-making and its injurious influence on workers' health"" was unsuccessful.          One of Liebig's frequent collaborators was Friedrich Wöhler. They met in 1826 in Frankfurt, after independently reporting on the preparation of two substances, cyanic acid and fulminic acid, that apparently had the same composition but very different characteristics. The silver fulminate investigated by Liebig, was explosive, whereas the silver cyanate found by Wöhler, was not. After reviewing the disputed analyses together, they agreed that both were valid. The discovery of these and other substances led Jöns Jacob Berzelius to suggest the idea of isomers, substances that are defined not simply by the number and kind of atoms in the molecule but also by the arrangement of those atoms.          In 1832, Justus Liebig and Friedrich Wöhler published an investigation of the oil of bitter almonds. They transformed pure oil into several halogenated compounds, which were further transformed in other reactions. Throughout these transformations, ""a single compound"" (which they named benzoyl) ""preserves its nature and composition unchanged in nearly all its associations with other bodies."" Their experiments proved that a group of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms can behave like an element, take the place of an element, and can be exchanged for elements in chemical compounds. This laid the foundation for the doctrine of compound radicals, which can be seen as an early step in the development of structural chemistry.          The 1830s were a period of intense investigation of organic compounds by Liebig and his students, and of vigorous debate about the theoretical implications of their results. Liebig published on a wide variety of topics, personally averaging thirty papers per year between 1830 and 1840. Liebig not only isolated individual substances, but also studied their interrelationships and the ways in which they degraded and metamorphosed into other substances, looking for clues to the understanding of both chemical composition and physiological function. Other significant contributions by Liebig during this time include his examination of          the nitrogen content of bases;           the study of chlorination and the isolation of chloral (1832);          the identification of the ethyl radical (1834);          the oxidation of alcohol and formation of aldehyde (1835);          the polybasic theory of organic acids (1838);          and the degradation of urea (1837).          Writing about the analysis of urine, a complex organic product, he made a declaration that reveals both the changes that were occurring in chemistry over a short time and the impact of his own work. At a time when many chemists such as Jöns Jakob Berzelius still insisted on a hard and fast separation between the organic and inorganic, Liebig asserted:          Liebig's arguments against any chemical distinction between living (physiological) and dead chemical processes proved a great inspiration to several of his students and others who were interested in materialism. Though Liebig distanced himself from the direct political implications of materialism, he tacitly supported the work of Karl Vogt (1817–1895), Jacob Moleschott (1822–1893), and Ludwig Büchner (1824–1899).          By the 1840s, Liebig was attempting to apply theoretical knowledge from organic chemistry to real-world problems of food availability. His book ""Die organische Chemie in ihrer Anwendung auf Agricultur und Physiologie (Organic Chemistry in its Application to Agriculture and Physiology)"" (1840) promoted the idea that chemistry could revolutionize agricultural practice, increasing yields and lowering costs. It was widely translated, vociferously critiqued, and highly influential.          Liebig's book discussed chemical transformations within living systems, both plant and animal, outlining a theoretical approach to agricultural chemistry. The first part of the book focused on plant nutrition, the second on chemical mechanisms of putrefaction and decay. Liebig's awareness of both synthesis and degradation led him to become an early advocate of conservation, promoting ideas such as the recycling of sewage.          Liebig argued against prevalent theories about role of humus in plant nutrition, which held that decayed plant matter was the primary source of carbon for plant nutrition. Fertilizers were believed to act by breaking down humus, making it easier for plants to absorb. Associated with such ideas was the belief that some sort of ""vital force"" distinguished reactions involving organic as opposed to inorganic materials.          Early studies of photosynthesis had identified carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen as important, but disagreed over their sources and mechanisms of action. Carbon dioxide was known to be taken in and oxygen released during photosynthesis, but researchers suggested that oxygen was obtained from carbon dioxide, rather than from water. Hydrogen was believed to come primarily from water. Researchers disagreed about whether sources of carbon and nitrogen were atmospheric or soil-based. Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure's experiments, reported in ""Recherches Chimiques sur la Végétation"" (1804), suggested that carbon was obtained from atmospheric rather than soil-based sources, and that water was a likely source of hydrogen. He also studied the absorption of minerals by plants, and observed that mineral concentrations in plants tended to reflect their presence in the soil in which the plants were grown. However, the implications of De Saussure's results for theories of plant nutrition were neither clearly discussed nor easily understood.          Liebig reaffirmed the importance of De Saussures' findings, and used them to critique humus theories, while regretting the limitations of De Saussure's experimental techniques. Using more precise methods of measurement as a basis for estimation, he pointed out contradictions such as the inability of existing soil humus to provide enough carbon to support the plants growing in it. By the late 1830s, researchers like Karl Sprengel were using Liebig's methods of combustion analysis to assess manures, concluding that their value could be attributed to their constituent minerals. Liebig synthesized ideas about the mineral theory of plant nutrition and added his own conviction that inorganic materials could provide nutrients as effectively as organic sources.          In his theory of mineral nutrients, Liebig identified the chemical elements of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) as essential to plant growth. He reported that plants acquire Carbon (C) and Hydrogen (H) from the atmosphere and from water (H2O). As well as emphasizing the importance of minerals in the soil, he argued that plants feed on nitrogen compounds derived from the air. This assertion was a source of contention for many years, and turned out to be true for legumes, but not for other plants.          Liebig also popularized Carl Sprengel's ""Theorem of minimum"" (known as Law of the Minimum), stating that plant growth is not determined by the total resources available, but by the scarcest available resource. A plant's development is limited by the one essential mineral that is in the relatively shortest supply. This concept of limitation can be visualized as ""Liebig's barrel"", a metaphorical barrel in which each stave represents a different element. A nutrient stave that is shorter than the others will cause the liquid contained in the barrel to spill out at that level. This is a qualitative version of the principles used for determining the application of fertilizer in modern agriculture.          ""Organic Chemistry"" was not intended as a guide to practical agriculture. Liebig's lack of experience in practical applications, and differences between editions of the book, fueled considerable criticism. Nonetheless, Liebig’s writings had a profound impact on agriculture, spurring experiment and theoretical debate in Germany, England, and France.          One of his most recognized accomplishments is the development of nitrogen-based fertilizer. In the first two editions of his book (1840, 1842), Liebig reported that there was not sufficient nitrogen in the atmosphere, and argued that nitrogen-based fertilizer was needed to grow the healthiest possible crops. Liebig believed that nitrogen could be supplied in the form of ammonia, and recognized the possibility of substituting chemical fertilizers for natural ones (animal dung, etc.)          He later became convinced that nitrogen was sufficiently supplied by precipitation of ammonia from the atmosphere, and argued vehemently against the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers for many years. An early commercial attempt to produce his own fertilizers was unsuccessful, due to lack of testing in actual agricultural conditions, and to lack of nitrogen in the mixtures.          Liebig's difficulties in reconciling theory and practice reflected that the real world of agriculture was more complex than was at first realized. By the publication of the seventh German edition of ""Agricultural Chemistry"" he had moderated some of his views, admitting some mistakes and returning to the position that nitrogen-based fertilizers were beneficial or even necessary. Nitrogen fertilizers are now widely used throughout the world, and their production is a substantial segment of the chemical industry.          Liebig's work on applying chemistry to plant and animal physiology was especially influential. By 1842, he had published ""Chimie organique appliquée à la physiologie animale et à la pathologie"", published in English as "" Animal chemistry, or, Organic chemistry in its applications to physiology and pathology"", presenting a chemical theory of metabolism. The experimental techniques used by Liebig and others often involved controlling and measuring diet, and monitoring and analyzing the products of animal metabolism, as indicators of internal metabolic processes. Liebig saw similarities between plant and animal metabolism, and suggested that nitrogenous animal matter was similar to, and derived from, plant matter. He categorized foodstuffs into two groups, nitrogenous materials which he believed were used to build animal tissue, and non-nitrogenous materials which he believed were involved in separate processes of respiration and generation of heat.          French researchers such as Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Jean-Baptiste Boussingault believed that animals assimilated sugars, proteins, and fats from plant materials and lacked the ability to synthesize them. Liebig's work suggested a common ability of plants and animals to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones. His experiments on fat metabolism convinced him that animals must be able to synthesize fats from sugars and starch. Other researchers built upon his work, confirming the abilities of animals to synthesize sugar and build fat.          Liebig also studied respiration, at one point measuring the ""ingesta and excreta"" of 855 soldiers, a bodyguard of the Grand Duke of Hessen-Darmstadt, for an entire month. He outlined an extremely speculative model of equations in which he attempted to explain how protein degradation might balance within a healthy body and result in pathological imbalances in cases of illness or inappropriate nutrition. This proposed model was justifiably criticized. Berzelius stingingly stated that ""this facile kind of physiological chemistry is created at the writing table"". Some of the ideas that Liebig had enthusiastically incorporated were not supported by further research. The third and last edition of ""Animal chemistry"" (1846) was substantially revised and did not include the equations.           The third area discussed in ""Animal Chemistry"" was fermentation and putrefaction. Liebig proposed chemical explanations for processes such as eremacausis (organic decomposition), describing the rearrangement of atoms as a result of unstable ""affinities"" reacting to external causes such as air or already decaying substances. Liebig identified the blood as the site of the body's ""chemical factory"", where he believed processes of synthesis and degradation took place. He presented a view of disease in terms of chemical process, in which healthy blood could be attacked by external contagia; secreting organs sought to transform and excrete such substances; and failure to do so could lead to their elimination through the skin, lungs, and other organs, potentially spreading contagion. Again, although the world was much more complicated than his theory, and many of his individual ideas were later proved wrong, Liebig managed to synthesize existing knowledge in a way that had significant implications for doctors, sanitarians and social reformers. The English medical journal ""The Lancet"" reviewed Liebig's work and translated his chemical lectures as part of its mission to establish a new era of medicine. Liebig's ideas stimulated significant medical research, led to the development of better techniques for testing experimental models of metabolism, and pointed to chemistry as fundamental to the understanding of health and disease.          In 1850 Liebig investigated spontaneous human combustion, dismissing the simplistic explanations based on ethanol due to alcoholism.          Liebig drew upon his work in plant nutrition and plant and animal metabolism to develop a theory of nutrition, which had significant implications for cookery. In his ""Researches on the chemistry of food"" (1847) Liebig argued that it was important to eat not only meat fibre, but also meat juices, which contained various inorganic chemicals. These vital ingredients would be lost during conventional boiling or roasting in which cooking liquids were discarded. For optimum nutritional quality, Liebig advised that cooks should either sear the meat initially to retain fluids, or retain and use cooking liquids (as in soups or stews).          Liebig was acclaimed in ""The Lancet"" for revealing ""the true principles of cookery"", and physicians promoted ""rational diets"" based on his ideas. Well-known British cookery writer Eliza Acton responded to Liebig by modifying the cookery techniques in the third edition of her ""Modern Cookery for Private Families"", and subtitling the edition accordingly. Liebig's idea that ""searing meat seals in the juices"", though still widely believed, is not true.          Building on his theories of the nutritional value of meat fluids, and seeking an inexpensive nutrition source for Europe’s poor, Liebig developed a formula for producing beef extract. The details were published in 1847 so that ""the benefit of it should ... be placed at the command of as large a number of persons as possible by the extension of the manufacture, and consequently a reduction in the cost"".          Production was not economically feasible in Europe, where meat was expensive, but in Uruguay and New South Wales meat was an inexpensive byproduct of the leather industry. In 1865, Liebig partnered with Belgian engineer George Christian Giebert, and was named scientific director of the Liebig's Extract of Meat Company, located in Fray Bentos, Uruguay.          Other companies also attempted to market meat extracts under the name ""Liebig's Extract of Meat"". In Britain, a competitor's right to use the name was successfully defended on the grounds that the name had fallen into general use and become a generic term before the creation of any particular company. The judge asserted that ""Purchasers must use their eyes"", and considered the presentation of the products to be sufficiently different to enable the discriminating consumer to determine which of the products bore Liebig's signature and was supported by Baron Liebig himself.          Liebig's company initially promoted their ""meat tea"" for its curative powers and nutritional value as a cheap, nutritious alternative to real meat. After claims of its nutritional value were questioned, they emphasized its convenience and flavour, marketing it as a comfort food. The Liebig company worked with popular cookery writers in various countries to popularize their products. German cookery writer Henriette Davidis wrote recipes for ""Improved and Economic Cookery"" and other cookbooks. Katherina Prato wrote an Austria-Hungarian recipe book, ""Die Praktische Verwerthung Kochrecepte"" (1879). Hannah M. Young was commissioned in England to write ""Practical Cookery Book"" for the Liebig Company. In the United States, Maria Parloa extolled the benefits of Liebig's extract. Colorful calendars and trading cards were also marketed to popularize the product.          The company also worked with English chemist Henry Enfield Roscoe to develop a related product which it registered some years after Liebig's death, under the ""Oxo"" trademark. Oxo was trademarked worldwide in 1899 and in the United Kingdom in 1900. Originally a liquid, Oxo was released in cubed solid form in 1911.          Liebig studied other foods as well. He promoted the use of baking powder to make lighter bread, studied the chemistry of coffee-making, and developed a breast milk substitute for babies who could not suckle. He is considered to have made possible the invention of Marmite, because of his discovery that yeast could be concentrated.          Liebig founded the journal ""Annalen der Chemie"", which he edited from 1832. Originally titled ""Annalen der Pharmacie"", it became ""Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie"" to more accurately reflect its content. It became the leading journal of Chemistry, and still exists. The volumes from his lifetime are often referenced just as ""Liebigs Annalen""; and following his death the title was officially changed to ""Justus Liebigs Annalen der Chemie"".          Liebig published widely in ""Liebigs Annalen"" and elsewhere, in newspapers as well as journals. Most of his books were published concurrently in both German and English, and many were translated into other languages as well. Some of his most influential titles include:          In addition to books and articles, he wrote thousands of letters, most of them to other scientists.          Liebig also played a direct role in the German publication of John Stuart Mill's ""Logic."" Through Liebig's close friendship with the Vieweg family publishing house, he arranged for his former student Jacob Schiel (1813–1889) to translate Mill's important work for German publication. Liebig liked Mill's ""Logic"" in part because it promoted science as a means to social and political progress, but also because Mill featured several examples of Liebig's research as an ideal for the scientific method. In this way, he sought to reform politics in the German states.          In 1852, Justus von Liebig accepted an appointment from King Maximilian II of Bavaria to the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. He also became scientific advisor to King Maxilimian II, who hoped to transform the University of Munich into a center for scientific research and development. In part, Liebig accepted the post because, at age 50, he was finding it increasingly difficult to supervise large numbers of laboratory students. His new accommodations in Munich reflected this shift in focus. They included a comfortable house suitable for extensive entertaining, a small laboratory, and a newly built lecture theatre capable of holding 300 people with a demonstration laboratory at the front. There he gave lectures to the university and fortnightly to the public. In his position as a promoter of science, Liebig was appointed president of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities, becoming perpetual president of the Royal Bavarian Academy of Sciences in 1858.          Liebig enjoyed a personal friendship with Maximilian II, who died on 10 March 1864. After Maximilian's death, Liebig and other liberal Protestant scientists in Bavaria were increasingly opposed by ultramontane Catholics.          Liebig died in Munich in 1873, and is buried in the Alter Südfriedhof in Munich.          Liebig was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1837.          He became a first class member of the Ludwig Order, founded by Ludwig I, and awarded by Ludwig II on 24 July 1837.          In 1838 he became correspondent of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands, when that became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1851 he joined as foreign member.          The British Royal Society awarded him the Copley Medal ""for his discoveries in organic chemistry, and particularly for his development of the composition and theory of organic radicals"" in 1840.          Ludwig II of Bavaria conveyed the title of Freiherr von Liebig on 29 December 1845. In English, the closest translation is ""Baron"".          In 1850, he received the French Légion d'honneur, presented by chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas, the French trade minister.          He was honored with the Prussian Order of Merit for Science by Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia in 1851.          In 1869, he was awarded the Albert Medal by the Royal Society of Arts, ""for his numerous valuable researches and writings, which have contributed most importantly to the development of food-economy and agriculture, to the advancement of chemical science, and to the benefits derived from that science by Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce.""          In 1946, after the end of World War II, the University of Giessen was officially renamed after him, ""Justus-Liebig-Universität Giessen"".          In 1953 the West German post office issued a stamp in his honor.          In 1953 the third General Assembly of the International Scientific Centre of Fertilizers (CIEC), founded in 1932, was organized in Darmstadt to honor Justus von Liebig on the 150 anniversary of his birth.          A portrait of Liebig hangs in the Burlington House headquarters of the Royal Society of Chemistry. It was presented to the society's forerunner, the Chemical Society, by his god-daughter Mrs Alec Tweedie, Ethel Brilliana Tweedie, Harley, daughter of Emma Muspratt.          Some organizations have granted medals in honor of Justus von Liebig. In 1871, the Versammlung deutscher Land- und Forstwirte (Assembly of German Farmers and Foresters) first awarded a Liebig Gold Medal, given to Theodor Reuning. The image was struck from a portrait commissioned in 1869 from Friedrich Brehmer.          For several years, the Liebig Trust Fund, established by Baron Liebig, was administered by the Royal Bavarian Academy of Sciences at Munich and members of the Liebig family. They were empowered to award gold and silver Liebig Medals to deserving German scientists ""for the purpose of encouraging research in agricultural science"". Silver medals could be awarded to scientists from other countries. Some of those who received medals include:          In 1903, the Verein deutscher Chemiker (Association of German Chemists) also had a medal struck using Brehmer's portrait. Their Liebig Medal was first awarded in 1903 to Adolf von Baeyer, and in 1904 to Dr. Rudolf Knietsch of the Badische Ani-lin und Soda-Fabrik. it continues to be awarded.          At the third World Congress of CIEC, held at Heidelberg in 1957, the ""Sprengel-Liebing Medal"" was awarded to Dr. E. Feisst, president of CIEC, for outstanding contributions in agricultural chemistry.","['1803 births', '1873 deaths', 'German chemists', 'German inventors', 'German scientists', 'Soil scientists', 'People from Darmstadt', 'People from the Grand Duchy of Hesse', 'Barons of Germany', 'University of Bonn alumni', 'University of Erlangen-Nuremberg alumni', 'University of Giessen faculty', 'Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich faculty', 'Recipients of the Copley Medal', 'Recipients of the Pour le M\xc3\xa9rite (civil class)', 'Members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences', 'Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences', 'Foreign Members of the Royal Society', 'Corresponding Members of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences', 'Members of the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art', 'Burials at the Alter S\xc3\xbcdfriedhof', 'Members of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences', 'Justus von Liebig']"

658978,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=658978,Kents Cavern,"Kents Cavern is a cave system in Torquay, Devon, England. It is notable for its archaeological and geological features. The cave system is open to the public and has been a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1952 and a Scheduled Ancient Monument since 1957.          The caverns and passages were formed in the early Pleistocene period by water action, and have been occupied by one of at least eight separate, discontinuous native populations to have inhabited the British Isles. The other key paleolithic sites in the UK are Happisburgh, Pakefield, Boxgrove, Swanscombe, Pontnewydd, Paviland, and Gough's Cave.          A prehistoric maxilla (upper jawbone) fragment was discovered in the cavern during a 1927 excavation by the Torquay Natural History Society, and named ""Kents Cavern 4."" The specimen is on display at the Torquay Museum.          In 1989 the fragment was radiocarbon dated to 36,400–34,700 years BP, but a 2011 study that dated fossils from neighbouring strata produced an estimate of 44,200–41,500 years BP. The same study analysed the dental structure of the fragment and determined it to be ""Homo sapiens"" rather than ""Homo neanderthalensis"", thus making it the earliest anatomically modern human fossil yet discovered in northwestern Europe.          Maxilla Kent's Cavern 4, then the Gravettian Paviland 1 and Eel Point represents the oldest anatomically modern humans known from Britain.          Kents Cavern is first recorded as Kents Hole Close on a 1659 deed when the land was leased to John Black. The earliest evidence of exploration of the caves in historic times is two inscriptions, ""William Petre 1571"" and ""Robert Hedges 1688"" engraved on stalagmites. The first recorded excavation was that of Thomas Northmore in 1824. Northmore's work attracted the attention of William Buckland, the first Reader in Geology at the University of Oxford, who sent a party including John MacEnery to explore the caves in an attempt to find evidence that Mithras was once worshipped in the area. MacEnery, the Roman Catholic chaplain at Torre Abbey, conducted systematic excavations between 1824 and 1829. When MacEnery reported to the British Association the discovery of flint tools below the stalagmites on the cave floor, his work was derided as contrary to Bishop James Ussher's Biblical chronology dating the Creation to 4004 BC.          In September 1845 the recently-created Torquay Natural History Society requested permission from Sir Lawrence Palk to explore the caves to obtain fossils and artefacts for the planned Torquay Museum, and as a result Edward Vivian and William Pengelly were allowed to conduct excavations between 1846 and 1858. Vivian reported to the Geological Society in 1847, but at the time, it was generally believed that early humans had entered the caves long after the formation of the cave structures examined. This changed when in the Autumn of 1859, following the work of Pengelly at the Brixham Cavern and of Jacques de Perthes in France, the Royal Society, the Society of Antiquaries, and the British Association agreed that the excavations had established the antiquity of humanity.          In 1865 the British Association created a committee, led by Pengelly, to fully explore the cave system over the course of fifteen years. It was Pengelly's party that discovered Robert Hedges' stalagmite inscription, and from the stalagmite's growth since that time deduced that human-created artefacts found under the formation could be half a million years old. Pengelly plotted the position of every bone, flint, and other artefact he discovered during the excavations, and afterward continued working with the Torquay Natural History Society until his death in 1892 at his home less than 2 km from the caves.          In 1903 Kents Cavern, then part of Lord Haldon's estate, was sold to Francis Powe, a carpenter who originally used the caves as a workshop while making beach huts for the Torquay sea front. Powe's son, Leslie Powe, turned the caves into a tourist attraction by laying concrete paths, installing electric lighting, and building visitor facilities that later were improved, in turn, by his son John Powe. The caves, now owned by Nick Powe, celebrated 100 years of Powe family ownership on 23 August 2003 with special events including an archæological dig for children and a display by a cave rescue team. A year later a new £500,000 visitor centre was opened, including a restaurant and gift shop.          Attracting 80,000 tourists a year, Kents Cavern is an important tourist attraction and this was recognised in 2000 when it was awarded Showcave of the Year award and later in November 2005 when it was awarded a prize for being Torquay's Visitor Attraction of the year.          ""Hampsley Cavern"" in Agatha Christie's 1924 novel ""The Man in the Brown Suit"", is based on Kents Cavern. The 2011 science fiction romance ""Time Watchers: The Greatest of These"", by Julie Reilly, uses Kents Cavern as a principal setting in three different time periods.","['Archaeological sites in Devon', 'Caves of Devon', 'Geology of Devon', 'Scheduled Ancient Monuments in Devon', 'Show caves in the United Kingdom', 'Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Devon', 'Stone Age sites in England', 'Torquay', 'Paleoanthropological sites']"

8084684,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8084684,K. Thamboosamy Pillay,"K. Thamboosamy Pillay (Tamil: தம்புசாமி பிள்ளை) was a prominent Malaysian of Tamil origin during the pre-independence years. He was considered the leader of the Tamil community. He was a wealthy businessman, tin miner, moneylender and government contractor.          Thamboosamy was one of the founders and one of the original Trustees of Victoria Institution as well as the founder of the Sri Mahamariamman Temple, Kuala Lumpur.          Born in Singapore in 1850, K. Thamboosamy Pillay received his early education at Raffles Institution. He sailed to Klang in 1875 with James Guthrie Davidson, when the latter was appointed Malaya's first British Resident. Prior to that, he had been a clerk in the legal firm in which Davidson was a partner.          He was later transferred to the Treasury where he eventually became chief clerk and acted as State Treasurer on a few occasions. He was sent to India by the Malayan Government to bring over the first batch of Indian immigrants for the Railway and Public Works. Thamboosamy resigned from Government service in the 1880s and, going into partnership with towkay Loke Yew, managed the New Tin Mining Company in Rawang. They were the first to use electric pumps for mining in Malaya.          A Justice of Peace and member of the prestigious KL Sanitary Board, Thamboosamy was the acknowledged leader of the Tamil community. His other business interests included coffee planting, real estate and construction. He constructed part of the main road from Kuala Lumpur to Kuala Kubu. He was a member of both the Selangor Club and the Turf Club and owned several horses.          Thamboosamy died in 1902 in Singapore, where he had gone to attend a meeting at the Singapore Turf Club.          A Justice of Peace and member of the prestigious KL Sanitary Board, Thamboosamy was the acknowledged leader of the Indian community in Malaya, especially in Kuala Lumpur.          Thamboosamy was one of the founders and one of the original Trustees of Victoria Institution. One of the sports houses in VI is named after him. His son, K. T. Ganapathy Pillay, was a Victorian and served as the second President of the VIOBA.          The Sri Mahamariamman Temple, Kuala Lumpur was founded by Thamboosamy in 1873 and was initially used as a private shrine by the Pillai family. The family threw open the temple doors to the public in the late 1920s and eventually handed the management of the temple over to a board of trustees.          This is the oldest functioning Hindu temple in Malaysia. It is also reputed to be the richest in the country. The Temple was originally sited somewhere near the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station. It shifted to its present location along Jalan Tun H.S. Lee (next to KL's Chinatown) in 1885.          He was also said to have discovered Batu Caves, with its ""vel""-shaped entrance, and was inspired to start a Hindu temple in devotion to Lord Muruga.          So great was Thamboosamy's philanthropic spirit, that he donated money to whoever needed it, regardless of race or religion. He contributed a sizeable amount of money to the building fund of St. Mary's Cathedral, Kuala Lumpur in 1893, despite being a Hindu.          A street in the Chow Kit district and a Tamil primary school in Sentul are also named in his memory.","['1850 births', '1902 deaths', 'Malaysian businesspeople', 'Malaysian people of Indian descent', 'Tamil businesspeople', 'Businesspeople of Indian descent', 'Malaysian Hindus']"
3256220,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3256220,Robert Gardner (footballer),"Robert Gardner (31 March 1847 – 28 February 1887) was an important figure in Scottish football history. He was a match arranger, goalkeeper and team captain for Queen's Park during the 1860s until 1874. A letter of his, dated 1868, is the oldest surviving letter pertaining to association football. He was also the first goalkeeper to captain an international side.          Gardner was born in Glasgow and brought up in the city. Pictures show that he wore a full beard. He was evidently very well educated. According to a contemporary cartoon, he may have relieved the boredom of long periods of inactivity by smoking his pipe on the field. He married Mary Arrol, cousin of the engineer Sir William Arrol, and they had three sons. He found work on Sir William Arrol's Forth Bridge project at South Queensferry, where he died, before he was 40, on 28 February 1887.          Gardner was one of the original members of Queen's Park Football Club. He was originally a forward but switched to goalkeeper in 1872. Apart from four goals conceded in an international match in 1873, Gardner did not concede a goal until January 1874. This is considered phenomenal when one considers that he may not have been allowed to use his hands for much of that time, and that goalkeeping technique would have been in a primitive state. However, although nineteenth century goalkeeping seems to have been almost entirely ""on the goal line"", the basic stalwart technique of ""narrowing the angle"" seems to have been used by Gardner. He was almost certainly the best goalkeeper of his time.          Gardner was instrumental in arranging the first official international football match, Scotland versus England in 1872, called by many ""the most important game in football history"", because the English played a style based on individual dribbling, while the Scots played a passing style; and the rules for the match were standardised (the Scottish rules). The Scottish side for this match consisted entirely of Queen's Park players. Robert Gardner was Scotland's first ever team captain, who selected his team, and kept goal during most of the 0–0 draw, although during the early stages of the second half he swapped places with forward Robert Smith and played part of the match up front before returning to the goal.          Gardner kept goal and captained Scotland against England the following year. The game was won 4–2 by England in London against a Scottish side which was partly composed of English-based players because the Scottish Football Association budget only stretched to the rail fares of seven players.          Gardner's switch of club to Clydesdale in 1874 lost him the Scottish captaincy when the Queen's Park players refused to be captained by a player from another club. He still kept goal for Scotland against England for the following two years, with a 2–1 win and a 2–2 draw. Gardner kept goal and captained Clydesdale in the first Scottish cup final in 1874, playing against Queen's Park. Although his side lost 2–0, contemporary accounts of the match home in on Gardner's magnificent display of goalkeeping against his old club.          In 1878 he made his fifth and last appearance as Scotland's last line of defence, and had the satisfaction of taking part in Scotland's 7–2 drubbing of England. Gardner also served as referee, handling the first international match between Scotland and Wales on 25 March 1876, and was a founding member of the Scottish Football Association serving as its President from 1877 to 1878.","['1847 births', '1887 deaths', 'Sportspeople from Glasgow', 'Scottish footballers', 'Scotland international footballers', 'Association football goalkeepers', ""Queen's Park F.C. players"", 'Clydesdale F.C. players']"
308577,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=308577,John Turturro,"John Michael Turturro () (born February 28, 1957) is an Italian-American actor, writer and director known for his roles in the films ""Do the Right Thing"" (1989), ""Miller's Crossing"" (1990), ""Barton Fink"" (1991), ""Quiz Show"" (1994), ""The Big Lebowski"" (1998), ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" (2000) and the first three films in the ""Transformers"" film series (2007–2011). He has appeared in over sixty films, and has worked frequently with the Coen brothers, Adam Sandler and Spike Lee.          An Emmy Award winner, Turturro has also been nominated for three Screen Actors Guild Awards and a Golden Globe Award.          Turturro was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Katherine, an amateur jazz singer who worked in a Navy yard during World War II, and Nicholas Turturro, a carpenter and construction worker who fought as a Navy sailor on D-Day. Turturro's mother was Sicilian (from Aragona near Agrigento) and his father immigrated from Giovinazzo, Bari, Italy at the age of six. Turturro was raised a Roman Catholic and moved to the Rosedale section of Queens, New York with his family when he was six. He majored in Theatre Arts at the State University of New York at New Paltz, and completed his MFA at the Yale School of Drama.          Turturro's first film appearance was a non-speaking extra role in Martin Scorsese's critically acclaimed ""Raging Bull"" (1980). He created the title role of John Patrick Shanley's ""Danny and the Deep Blue Sea"" at the Playwrights Conference at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center in 1983. He repeated it the following year Off-Broadway and won an Obie Award.          Spike Lee liked Turturro's performance in ""Five Corners"" so much that he cast him in ""Do the Right Thing"". This movie was the first of a long-standing collaboration between the director and Turturro, which includes work together on a total of nine films—more than any other actor in the Lee oeuvre-- including ""Mo' Better Blues"" (1990), ""Jungle Fever"" (1991), ""Clockers"" (1995), ""Girl 6"" (1996), ""He Got Game"" (1998), ""Summer of Sam"" (1999), ""She Hate Me"" (2004), and ""Miracle at St. Anna"" (2008).          Turturro has appeared in both comedy and drama films, and engaged in an extended collaboration with the Coen Brothers—he appeared in their films ""Miller's Crossing"" (1990), ""Barton Fink"" (1991), ""The Big Lebowski"" (1998), and ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" (2000). He has also appeared in several of Adam Sandler's movies, such as ""Mr. Deeds"" (2002) and ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" (2008). He played a severely disturbed patient of Jack Nicholson's character in the comedy ""Anger Management"" and played Johnny Depp's character's antagonist in ""Secret Window"". Turturro hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" in 1994, where he spoofed his then-recently made film, ""Quiz Show"", being told he was ineligible to host unless he answered questions in a booth and if he failed, the honor of hosting would go to Joey Buttafuoco, who was actually backstage to witness Turturro's test. He won an Emmy award for his portrayal of Adrian Monk's brother Ambrose in the USA Network series ""Monk"", and reprised the role on numerous occasions. He has also been nominated and won many awards from film organizations such as Screen Actors Guild, Cannes Film Festival, Golden Globes and others.          Turturro produced and directed, as well as acted in, the film ""Illuminata"" (1999), which also starred his wife, actress Katherine Borowitz. He wrote and directed the film ""Romance and Cigarettes"" (2005). In 2006 he appeared in Robert De Niro's ""The Good Shepherd"", and as the Sector 7 agent Simmons in three films of the ""Transformers"" live-action series. In 2010 he directed (and had cameo on-screen appearances in) ""Passione"", which chronicles the rich musical heritage of Naples, Italy.          His stage directorial debut was in October 2011, with the Broadway play ""Relatively Speaking"", in which he guided an ensemble of veteran actors in a production of three comedic one-act plays, written by Elaine May, Woody Allen and Ethan Coen. The cast included Julie Kavner, Marlo Thomas, Mark Linn-Baker and Steve Guttenberg.          Turturro's fifth directorial film ""Fading Gigolo"" premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in mid-September 2013. Turturro also acts in the film alongside Woody Allen, who played a novice pimp overseeing the sex work of Turturro's character. During a September 2013 interview, Turturro expressed his intention to draw parallels between sex work and acting, explaining that the latter is a ""service business"" in which actors are ""acting out people's wishes or fantasies."" In March 2014, Turturro received the Career Achievement tribute and award at the 31st Edition of the Miami International Film Festival at the Olympia Theater in Downtown Miami.          Turturro's brother is actor Nicholas Turturro. Artist Ralph Turturro, composer and film director Richard Termini and actress Aida Turturro are his cousins. He has two sons: Amedeo (born 1990) and Diego (born 2000), with his wife, actress Katherine Borowitz.          Turturro participates as a member of the Jury for the NYICFF, a local New York City Film Festival dedicated to screening films for children between the ages of 3 and 18. In January 2011, Turturro received his Italian passport, and holds dual Italian and U.S. citizenship.","['1957 births', 'American people of Italian descent', 'American people of Sicilian descent', '20th-century American male actors', '21st-century American male actors', 'Male actors from New York City', 'American male film actors', 'American film directors', 'American male screenwriters', 'American male stage actors', 'American male television actors', 'David di Donatello winners', 'Film directors from New York City', 'Italian male film actors', 'Italian film directors', 'Italian screenwriters', 'Italian male stage actors', 'Italian male television actors', 'Living people', 'Male actors of Italian descent', 'Obie Award recipients', 'People from Brooklyn', 'People from Queens, New York', 'People of Apulian descent', 'Primetime Emmy Award winners', 'State University of New York at New Paltz alumni', 'Yale School of Drama alumni']"
422786,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=422786,Primorial,"In mathematics, and more particularly in number theory, primorial is a function from natural numbers to natural numbers similar to the factorial function, but rather than successively multiplying positive integers, only prime numbers are multiplied.          There are two conflicting definitions that differ in the interpretation of the argument: the first interprets the argument as an index into the sequence of prime numbers (so that the function is strictly increasing), while the second interprets the argument as a bound on the prime numbers to be multiplied (so that the function value at any composite number is the same as at its predecessor). The rest of this article uses the latter interpretation.          The name ""primorial"", attributed to Harvey Dubner, draws an analogy to ""primes"" the same way the name ""factorial"" relates to ""factors"".          For the ""n""th prime number ""p"" the primorial ""p#"" is defined as the product of the first ""n"" primes:          where ""p"" is the ""k""th prime number.          For instance, ""p#"" signifies the product of the first 5 primes:          The first six primorials ""p#"" are:          The sequence also includes ""p#"" = 1 as empty product.          Asymptotically, primorials ""p#"" grow according to:          where formula_4 is the little-o notation.          In general, for a positive integer ""n"" such a primorial ""n#"" can also be defined, namely as the product of those primes ≤ ""n"":          where, formula_6 is the prime-counting function , giving the number of primes ≤ ""n"".          This is equivalent to:          For example, 12# represents the product of those primes ≤ 12:          Since formula_9, this can be calculated as:          Consider the first 12 primorials ""n""#:          We see that for composite ""n"" every term n# simply duplicates the preceding term (""n"" − 1)#, as given in the definition. In the above example we have that 12# = ""p""# = 11#, since 12 is a composite number.          The natural logarithm of ""n""# is the first Chebyshev function, written formula_11 or formula_12, which approaches the linear ""n"" for large ""n"".          Primorials ""n""# grow according to:          The idea of multiplying all known primes occurs in some proofs of the infinitude of the prime numbers, where it is used to derive the existence of another prime.          Primorials play a role in the search for prime numbers in additive arithmetic progressions. For instance, 2236133941 + 23# results in a prime, beginning a sequence of thirteen primes found by repeatedly adding 23#, and ending with 5136341251. 23# is also the common difference in arithmetic progressions of fifteen and sixteen primes.          Every highly composite number is a product of primorials (e.g. 360 = 2·6·30).          Primorials are all square-free integers, and each one has more distinct prime factors than any number smaller than it. For each primorial ""n"", the fraction formula_14 is smaller than for any lesser integer, where formula_15 is the Euler totient function.          Any completely multiplicative function is defined by its values at primorials, since it is defined by its values at primes, which can be recovered by division of adjacent values.          Base systems corresponding to primorials (such as base 30, not to be confused with the primorial number system) have a lower proportion of repeating fractions than any smaller base.

36545635,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36545635,Schleswig Coldblood,"The Schleswig Coldblood () is a breed of medium-sized draught horse originally from the historic Schleswig region of the Jutland Peninsula, which today is divided between modern Denmark and Germany, and from which its name derives. It is found primarily in the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein, and also, in smaller numbers, in Lower Saxony. It shares the origins, ancestry and much of the history of the Danish Jutland breed, and shows some similarity to the British Suffolk Punch. It was bred as a working horse for agriculture and forestry; today it is used mostly to pull coaches, wagons and drays.          The Schleswig Coldblood originates from the area of the Duchy of Schleswig, in the southern part of the Jutland Peninsula, and has its origins in the Jutland horse. In about 1860 an imported English stallion, Oppenheim LXII, either a pure-bred or a part-bred Suffolk Punch, was introduced, and became the foundation stallion of the breed. In 1888 the breeding of warmbloods and coldbloods was separated, and in 1891 various associations of coldblood breeders in Schleswig were brought together in the , and systematic breeding began. The brand V.S.P in an oval on the off hindleg was chosen to identify registered horses and is still used today.          In 1893 the stallion Aldrup Munkedal 839 was born, a son of Munkedal II 585 and a descendant of Oppenheim LXII; he won the king's prize at the Jubilee celebrations in Odense in 1900, and 70,000 crowns were offered for him. From after the First World War all Schleswig Coldbloods descended from this stallion.          By 1910 the Verband recorded 12,000 breeding animals. Through regional agricultural shows, the Schleswig Coldblood became widely known and was sold throughout Germany. The division of Schleswig between Denmark and Germany in 1920, in the aftermath of the First World War, meant the loss of a large part of the breeding area and was a major setback. However numbers rose again, and in 1949 reached a peak of about 450 stallions and 20,000 or 25,000 brood mares in the hands of more than 15,000 breeders spread throughout Schleswig-Holstein, though more concentrated in the north. In 1958 two French stallions were added to the breeding stock.          In the years following the Second World War the mechanisation of agriculture, with the replacement of agricultural horses with tractors, led to a dramatic decline in numbers. By 1976 they had fallen to a low of 35 mares and 5 stallions, and in that year the old society was dissolved and the remaining animals were registered in the Schleswig-Holstein horse register in Kiel. A society for the protection of the breed was soon formed, and in 1991 this became the , or Schleswig horse breeders' association. The society has 200 members.          Since 1997 numbers have remained stable at about 200–250; in 2013 there were 189 mares and 26 stallions. The Schleswig Coldblood was listed as ""endangered"" by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations in 2007. In 2013 it was in Category II: ""seriously endangered"" on the Rote Liste of the Gesellschaft zur Erhaltung alter und gefährdeter Haustierrassen, the German national association for the conservation of historic and endangered domestic animal breeds, and was listed as ""minimally endangered"" by the European Association for Animal Production (EAAP).          Since 2012 a sub-population, the , or roughly ""Hanoverian coldblood of Schleswig origin"", has been included in the Schleswiger Coldblood breed; in 2012 there were a total of 62, 4 stallions and 58 mares.          The Schleswig Coldblood stands between (61–64 in) and weighs about . Stallions are often taller than mares. It has a short and straight head with kind eyes and a broad forehead; short, cresty neck; powerful shoulders; a long body with good depth in the girth; powerful hindquarters; short and stocky limbs with some feather. It is predominantly chestnut in colour though occasionally bay or grey. The Schleswig Coldblood is a good mover and has a placid nature. It is versatile and agile, with great endurance and very willing to learn.          The Schleswig Coldblood was bred for use as a working horse. It was used on farms and for hauling timber from forests, to pull omnibuses and brewery wagons in cities and for heavy work in the military. Today, they are still seen as working horses in the agriculture and timber industries, as well as used for various forms of recreational use, including driving and pulling wagonettes.","['Horse breeds', 'Horse breeds originating in Germany', 'Animal breeds on the GEH Red List']"

Monrad's father, Otto Sommer Monrad, an attorney, suffered from mental illness, and spent some years in institutions; he died in 1863.          Monrad studied theology and became a Lutheran minister, while beginning to participate in politics. He became editor of the Liberal publication, ""Foedrelandet"", in 1840, and was leader of the National Liberal Party and spearheaded the movement towards a constitutional Denmark after 1848, the year in which he became a bishop. In the following year, he became a member of Parliament and was Minister of Church Affairs in the new government.          As Council President (1863-1864), he was the Danish state leader during the early part of Second Schleswig War, against the German Confederation led by Otto von Bismarck, which resulted in the Peace of Vienna.          After this war, a depressed and disillusioned Monrad emigrated to New Zealand. After sending his sons to Nelson and other districts of New Zealand to scout for land, he chose to settle in Palmerston North in the North Island of New Zealand. He bought of land at Karere Block. He first lived in a small hut and then erected a timber house and started clearing bushland. He and his family farmed cows and sheep.          Monrad helped the New Zealand Company to find suitable settlers from Scandinavia and helped many Danish immigrants find land to settle on, most notably in the area of Dannevirke.          His work was disturbed by Māori rioters, members of the Hauhau cult under Chief Titokowaru. Monrad buried his belongings and went with the family to Wellington and then went back to Denmark in 1869. His sons Viggo and Johannes later returned to Karere to become farmers.          Before leaving New Zealand, he presented to the New Zealand government a precious collection of sketches and etchings by old European masters such as Rembrandt, Rubens, Albrecht Dürer and van Dyck. They are now part of the collection at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa and are occasionally on display there.

The album was Wilson's first album recorded after she left the last line-up of the Supremes which included herself, Scherrie Payne and Susaye Greene. The Supremes had released their 29th and last studio album, ""Mary, Scherrie & Susaye"", in October 1976, just nine months before they officially disbanded as a group. During June 1977, Wilson decided to leave the Supremes (who were managed by her then-husband Pedro Ferrer at the time). Prior to her husband becoming the manager of the group, Wilson and Berry Gordy had an argument backstage at the Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas in 1970 (the same night Diana Ross made her farewell performance with the group to start a solo career). The argument started when Gordy had wanted to replace Jean Terrell (who was already chosen to take Ross's place as lead) with Syreeta Wright. Finally deciding to put her foot down against Gordy, Wilson refused to let Wright take Terrell's place, leading Gordy to state that he was washing his hands of the group, leaving Wilson and her husband to manage the group and keep the group's career alive.          Wilson had decided to begin a solo career after all three members could not agree on the Supremes' musical direction, leaving Payne and Greene to try - unsuccessfully - to find a replacement for Wilson.          Upon leaving the Supremes, Wilson became involved in a protracted legal battle with Motown Records over its management of the Supremes. After an out-of-court settlement, she signed a solo record deal with Motown. Originally, Marvin Gaye was scheduled to produce the album. However, Gaye was preoccupied with his divorce from Berry Gordy's elder sister Anna Gordy at the time, thus leaving her to work with Hal Davis who produced some of The Supremes earlier material as well as having worked with The Jackson 5 and with Michael Jackson on his early solo albums for Motown.          The album was a commercial failure and did not chart. Its lead single, ""Red Hot"", squeaked into the ""Billboard"" R&B singles chart at #95. Another single, ""Pick Up the Pieces"", failed to chart at all. An extended version of ""Red Hot"" was made available as a 12-inch single and reached #85 on the disco charts in October 1979.          After the release of ""Mary Wilson"", Wilson began working on her second solo album for Motown with English record producer Gus Dudgeon (who had already produced 4 new tracks for the new album). However, midway through the production of the album, Motown dropped Wilson from their roster in 1980.          Wilson's next album, ""Walk the Line"", would take some 13-years before finally seeing a release in 1992.","['1979 debut albums', 'Motown albums', 'Mary Wilson (singer) albums']"

17798882,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17798882,China–Vietnam relations,"The bilateral relations between the People's Republic of China and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam have been turbulent, despite their common socialist background. Centuries of conquest by modern China's imperial predecessor have given Vietnam an entrenched suspicion of Chinese attempts to dominate it. Though the PRC assisted North Vietnam during the Vietnam War, relations between the two nations soured following Vietnam's reunification in 1975. China and Vietnam fought a prolonged border war from 1979 to 1990, but have since worked to improve their diplomatic and economic ties. However, the two countries remain in dispute over territorial issues in the South China Sea. A 2014 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center showed 84% of Vietnamese were concerned that territorial disputes between China and neighbouring countries could lead to a military conflict.          China and Vietnam have interacted since the Chinese Warring States period and the Vietnamese Thục Dynasty of the 3rd century BC, as noted in the Vietnamese historical record ""Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư"". Between the 1st century BC and 15th century AD, Vietnam was subject to four separate periods of imperial Chinese domination, although it successfully asserted a degree of independence following the Battle of Bạch Đằng in 938 AD.          According to old Vietnamese historical records Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư and Khâm Định Việt Sử Thông Giám Cương Mục, An Dương Vương (Thục Phán) was a prince of the Chinese state of Shu (蜀, which shares the same Chinese character as his surname Thục), sent by his father first to explore what are now the southern Chinese provinces of Guangxi and Yunnan and second to move their people to modern-day northern Vietnam during the invasion of the Qin Dynasty.          Some modern Vietnamese believe that Thục Phán came upon the Âu Việt territory (modern-day northernmost Vietnam, western Guangdong, and southern Guangxi province, with its capital in what is today Cao Bằng Province). After assembling an army, he defeated King Hùng Vương XVIII, the last ruler of the Hồng Bàng Dynasty, in 258 BC. He proclaimed himself An Dương Vương (""King An Dương""). He then renamed his newly acquired state from Văn Lang to Âu Lạc and established the new capital at Phong Khê in the present-day Phú Thọ town in northern Vietnam, where he tried to build Cổ Loa Citadel), the spiral fortress approximately ten miles north of that new capital.          Han Chinese migration into Vietnam dated back to the era of 2nd century BC when Qin Shi Huang first placed northern Vietnam under Chinese rule, Chinese soldiers and fugitives from Central China migrated en masse into northern Vietnam from this time onwards, and introduced Chinese influences into Vietnamese culture. The Chinese military leader Zhao Tuo founded the Triệu dynasty which ruled Nanyue in southern China and northern Vietnam. The Qin Governor of Canton advisted Zhao to found his own independent Kingdom since the area was remote and there were many Chinese settlers in the area. The Chinese prefect of Jiaozhi Shi Xie ruled Vietnam as an autonomous warlord and was posthumously deified by later Vietnamese Emperors. Shi Xie was the leader of the elite ruling class of Han Chinese families who immigrated to Vietnam and played a major role in developing Vietnam's culture.          In 1884, during the time of Vietnam's Nguyễn Dynasty, Qing China and France fought a war which ended in a Chinese defeat. The resulting Treaty of Tientsin recognized French dominance over Vietnam and Indochina, spelling the end of formal Chinese influence on Vietnam, and the beginning of Vietnam's French colonial period.          Both China and Vietnam faced invasion and occupation by Imperial Japan during World War II, while Vietnam languished under the rule of the pro-Nazi Vichy French. In the Chinese provinces of Guangxi and Guangdong, Vietnamese revolutionaries led by Phan Bội Châu had arranged alliances with the Chinese nationalist Kuomintang prior to the war by marrying Vietnamese women to Chinese officers. Their children were at an advantage, since they could speak both languages, and they worked as agents for the revolutionaries, spreading revolutionary ideologies across borders. This intermarriage between Chinese and Vietnamese was viewed with alarm by the French. In addition, Chinese merchants married Vietnamese women, and provided funds and help for revolutionary agents.          Late in the war, with Japan and Nazi Germany nearing defeat, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt privately decided that the French should not reacquire their colonial property of French Indochina after the war was over. Roosevelt offered the Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek the entirety of Indochina to be put under Chinese rule. Reportedly, Chiang Kai-shek replied: ""Under no circumstances!"". In August 1943, China broke diplomatic relations with the Vichy France regime, with the ""Central Daily News"" announcing diplomatic relations were to be solely between the Chinese and Vietnamese people, with no French intermediary. China had planned to widely spread the propaganda of the Atlantic Charter and Roosevelt's statement on Vietnamese self-determination, in order to undermine French authority in Indochina.          However, Roosevelt switched his position on Vietnamese independence in order to gain the support of Free French Forces in Europe.          After the war, 200,000 Chinese troops under General Lu Han were sent by Chiang Kai-shek to Indochina north of the 16th parallel, with the aim of accepting the surrender of Japanese occupying forces. These troops remained in Indochina until 1946. The Chinese used the VNQDD, the Vietnamese branch of the Chinese Kuomintang, to increase their influence in Indochina and put pressure on their opponents. Chiang Kai-shek threatened the French with war to force them to negotiate with the Vietminh leader Ho Chi Minh. In February 1946, Chiang Kai-shek forced the French to surrender all of their concessions in China and renounce their extraterritorial privileges, in exchange for withdrawing from northern Indochina and allowing French troops to reoccupy the region.          Along with the Soviet Union, Communist China was an important strategic ally of North Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The Chinese Communist Party provided arms, military training and essential supplies to help the Communist North defeat South Vietnam and its ally, the United States, between 1954 and 1975. However, the Vietnamese Communists remained suspicious of China's perceived attempts to increase its influence over Vietnam.          Vietnam was an ideological battleground of the Sino-Soviet split of the 1960s. After the Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964, Chinese Premier Deng Xiaoping secretly promised the North Vietnamese 1 billion yuan in military and economic aid, on the condition that they refused all Soviet aid.          During the Vietnam War, the North Vietnamese and the Chinese had agreed to defer tackling their territorial issues until South Vietnam was defeated. These issues included the lack of delineation of Vietnam's territorial waters in the Gulf of Tonkin, and the question of sovereignty over the Paracel and Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. During the 1950s, half of the Paracels were controlled by China and half by South Vietnam. In 1958, North Vietnam accepted China's claim to the Paracels, relinquishing its own claim; one year earlier, China had ceded White Dragon Tail Island to North Vietnam. The potential of offshore oil deposits in the Gulf of Tonkin heightened tensions between China and South Vietnam. In 1973, with the Vietnam War drawing to a close, North Vietnam announced its intention to allow foreign companies to explore oil deposits in disputed waters. In January 1974, a clash between Chinese and South Vietnamese forces resulted in China taking complete control of the Paracels. After its absorption of South Vietnam in 1975, North Vietnam took over the South Vietnamese-controlled portions of the Spratly Islands. The unified Vietnam then canceled its earlier renunciation of its claim to the Paracels, while both China and Vietnam claim control over all the Spratlys, while both controlling portions of the island group.          In the wake of the Vietnam War, the Cambodian–Vietnamese War provoked tensions with China, which had allied itself with the Democratic Kampuchea. This, and Vietnam's close ties to the Soviet Union, made China consider it a threat to its regional sphere of influence. Tensions were furthermore heightened in the 1970s by the Vietnamese government's oppression of the Hoa minority, which consists of Vietnamese of Chinese ethnicity. By 1978, China ended its aid to Vietnam, which had signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union, establishing extensive commercial and military ties.          On February 17, 1979, the Chinese People's Liberation Army crossed the Vietnamese border, withdrawing on March 5 after a two-week campaign which devastated northern Vietnam and briefly threatened the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi. Both sides suffered relatively heavy losses with thousands of casualties. Subsequent peace talks broke down in December 1979, and both China and Vietnam began a major build-up of forces along the border. Vietnam fortified its border towns and districts and stationed as many as 600,000 troops; China stationed approximately 400,000 troops on its side of the border. Sporadic fighting on the border occurred throughout the 1980s, and China threatened to launch another attack to force Vietnam's exit from Cambodia.          With the collapse of the Soviet Union and Vietnam's exit from Cambodia in 1990, Sino-Vietnamese ties began improving. Both nations planned the normalization of their relations in a secret summit in Chengdu in September 1990, and officially normalized ties in November 1991. Since 1991, the leaders and high-ranking officials of both nations have exchanged visits. China and Vietnam both recognized and supported the post-1991 government of Cambodia, and supported each other's bid to join the World Trade Organization (WTO). In 1999, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Le Kha Phieu, visited Beijing, where he met General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Jiang Zemin and announced a joint ""16 Word Guideline"" for improved bilateral relations; a Joint Statement for Comprehensive Cooperation was issued in 2000. In 2000, Vietnam and China successfully resolved longstanding disputes over their land border and maritime rights in the Gulf of Tonkin. A joint agreement between China and ASEAN in 2002 marked out a process of peaceful resolution and guarantees against armed conflict. In 2002, Jiang Zemin made an official visit to Vietnam, where numerous agreements were signed to expand trade and cooperation and resolve outstanding disputes.          After both sides resumed trade links in 1991, growth in annual bilateral trade increased from only US$32 million in 1991 to almost USD $7.2 billion in 2004. By 2011, the trade volume had reached USD $25 billion. It is predicted that China will become Vietnam's largest single trading partner, overtaking the United States, by 2030. China's transformation into a major economic power in the 21st century has led to an increase of foreign investments in the bamboo network, a network of overseas Chinese businesses operating in the markets of Southeast Asia that share common family and cultural ties.          Vietnam's exports to China include crude oil, coal, coffee and food, while China exports pharmaceuticals, machinery, petroleum, fertilizers and automobile parts to Vietnam. China has become Vietnam's second-largest trading partner and the largest source of imports. Both nations are working to establish an ""economic corridor"" from China's Yunnan province to Vietnam's northern provinces and cities, and similar economic zones linking China's Guangxi province with Vietnam's Lạng Sơn and Quang Ninh provinces, and the cities of Hanoi and Haiphong. Air and sea links as well as a railway line have been opened between the two countries, along with national-level seaports in the frontier provinces and regions of the two countries. Joint ventures have furthermore been launched, such as the Thai Nguyen Steel Complex, which produces hundreds of thousands of tonnes of steel products.          In June 2011, Vietnam announced that its military would conduct new exercises in the South China Sea. China had previously voiced its disagreement over Vietnamese oil exploration in the area, stating that the Spratly Islands and the surrounding waters were its sovereign territory. Defense of the South China Sea was cited as one of the possible missions of the first Chinese aircraft carrier, the ""Liaoning"", which entered service in September 2012.          In October 2011, Nguyễn Phú Trọng, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, made an official visit to China at the invitation of General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Hu Jintao, with the aim of improving bilateral relations in the wake of the border disputes. However, on 21 June 2012, Vietnam passed a law entitled the Law on the Sea, which placed both the Spratly Islands and the Paracel Islands under Vietnamese jurisdiction, prompting China to label the move as ""illegal and invalid"". Simultaneously, China passed a law establishing the prefecture of Sansha City, which encompassed the Xisha (Paracel), Zhongsha, and Nansha (Spratly) Islands and the surrounding waters. Vietnam proceeded to strongly oppose the measure and reaffirmed its sovereignty over the islands. Other countries surrounding the South China Sea have claims to the two island chains, including Taiwan, Brunei, Malaysia, and the Philippines; nonetheless, the conflict remains predominantly between Vietnam and China.          In May 2013 Vietnam accused the PRC of hitting one of its fishing boats, while in May 2014 Vietnam accused China of ramming and sinking a fishing boat.          In June 2014 China declared there would be no military conflict with Vietnam as the two were sparring over an oil rig in disputed territory in the South China Sea. China at the time had 71 ships in the disputed area while Vietnam had 61.","['Bilateral relations of Vietnam', 'Bilateral relations of China', 'Economy of Yunnan', 'China\xe2\x80\x93Vietnam relations']"
25275931,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25275931,EJ Manuel,"Erik Rodriguez ""EJ"" Manuel, Jr. (born March 19, 1990) is an American football quarterback for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the Bills in the first round of the 2013 NFL Draft.          Manuel was born in Virginia Beach, Virginia. He attended Bayside High School Virginia Beach, where he played for the Bayside Marlins high school football team. His father, Erik, was childhood friends with NFL Hall of Fame defensive end Bruce Smith. In 2004, as a freshman, he started at quarterback and threw for 589 yards and seven touchdowns, as well as rushing for 219 yards and one touchdown. As a sophomore, he recorded 1,332 passing yards and eight touchdowns as well as 276 rushing yards and six touchdowns. As a junior, Manuel threw for 1,973 yards and 15 touchdowns while rushing for 345 yards and five touchdowns. In 2007, as a senior, Manuel passed for 1,859 yards, 18 touchdowns and rushed for 541 yards. He was considered a five-star recruit by Scout, a four star recruit by Rivals and both sites, as well as ""Sports Illustrated"", listed him the second best quarterback. He was an All-American quarterback in high school.          Manuel enrolled in Florida State University, where he played for coach Bobby Bowden and coach Jimbo Fisher's Florida State Seminoles football teams from 2008 to 2012. While he was a student, he joined the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity. Manuel became the second collegiate quarterback to win four straight bowl games, the first being Pat White of West Virginia.          Manuel took over for an injured Christian Ponder as the 4-5 Seminoles were in danger of finishing with a losing record for the first time since Bowden took over the program. His first start was an away game against Wake Forest. He completed 15 of 20 passes for 220 yards with one touchdown, leading the Seminoles to a 41-28 win over Wake Forest, who at the time had won three games in a row against Florida State. Manuel struggled in his second game against Maryland but still managed to pull out a much needed win making FSU bowl-eligible. Manuel's struggles continued against the dominating Florida Gators, and the mobile quarterback wasn't able to get into a rhythm as Florida State lost, 37-10.          Florida State entered the Gator Bowl 6-6 and in serious danger of letting legendary coach Bobby Bowden leave with a losing record. Manuel led Florida State to a 33-21 victory over the West Virginia Mountaineers and won the Gator Bowl MVP honors.          Manuel started twice in the 2010 season for Christian Ponder, who battled a nagging forearm injury. In his first start against Clemson, he picked up 71 yards on 15 carries. He also led the Seminoles to a victory in the 2010 Chick-fil-A Bowl against South Carolina when Christian Ponder was injured in the second quarter of the game.          In the 2011 season, EJ Manuel played in every game besides the loss at Clemson after injuring his shoulder in a loss against Oklahoma the previous week. He finished the season with 2,666 yards passing on a 65% completion rate. He also finished with 18 passing touchdowns, 4 rushing touchdowns, and 8 interceptions. He helped lead the Seminoles to a comeback win against the Notre Dame Fighting Irish in the Champs Sports Bowl by throwing for 249 yards and 2 touchdowns.          Manuel led the Seminoles to numerous wins over ACC rivals, an ACC Championship, and an Orange Bowl win against Northern Illinois for a 12-2 finish to his senior season.          Manuel led the Seminoles to a 12-win season for just the third time in program history and the first time since their dominant stretch in the 1990s. During his senior season, he threw for the second most yards in team history with 3,392, trailing only Chris Weinke's Heisman Trophy winning season, in which Weinke threw for 4,167 yards. Manuel went 25-6 as a starter, won the first BCS bowl for Florida State since 2000, won five out of six games against intrastate rivals Miami and Florida, and he also led the offense to its most prolific season in team history, cleanly surpassing the 1999 National Championship squad with 6,591 yards.          Career statistics          NFL.com analyst Bucky Brooks projected him as a top five quarterback heading into the 2013 draft and compared him to Josh Freeman. While Manuel possesses the blue-chip physical characteristics, work ethic and leadership qualities necessary to be successful at the NFL level, he has been faulted for somewhat inconsistent play at times during his college career.          Manuel was the 16th overall pick in the 2013 NFL Draft by the Buffalo Bills. Manuel was the only quarterback taken in the first round of the draft, a draft that was seen as especially thin at quarterback (the Bills, who originally drafted eighth and had a great need for a quarterback, even traded down to obtain more picks); Manuel was drafted ahead of higher-profile quarterbacks such as Matt Barkley and Geno Smith, as well as Ryan Nassib, who had played under Bills head coach Doug Marrone when Marrone coached the Syracuse Orange.          On June 14, 2013, Manuel signed a four year contract with the Buffalo Bills. The deal is worth a fully guaranteed $8.88 million, including a signing bonus of $4.85 million evenly spaced out annually ($1.2 million) over the next four years. His salary in 2013 will be $1.6 million, $2.0 million in 2014, $2.4 million in 2015, and $2.8 million in 2016.          Manuel made his professional debut on August 11, 2013, during the preseason against the Indianapolis Colts, completing 16 out of 21 passes for 107 yards and a touchdown. Manuel underwent an operation on his knee to remove fluid buildup after the second game of the preseason and it was unsure if he would be ready to start the 2013 regular season opener. On September 4, 2013, Doug Marrone announced at the team meeting that Manuel was confirmed to be the starter for Week 1. In week 1, Manuel completed his first touchdown to fellow rookie Robert Woods, on an 18 yard completion. On September 16, 2013, Manuel engineered his first fourth quarter comeback, with a nine-play, 80-yard touchdown march to bring his team from a six point deficit in the fourth quarter with seconds left in the game. The Buffalo Bills went on to win the Week 2 bout over the Carolina Panthers 24-23. Manuel was voted the ""Pepsi Next NFL Rookie of the Week"" for his performance.          On October 3, 2013, during the third quarter against the Cleveland Browns, Manuel sprained the lateral collateral ligament in his right knee. The injury caused him to miss the next 5 weeks of his rookie season. Manuel had an up and down first year, but was given a vote of confidence by coach Doug Marrone as he was announced as the starting quarterback for the 2014 season.          On September 28, 2014, in a game against the Houston Texans, one of Manuel's passes was intercepted by J.J. Watt and returned 80 yards for a touchdown. The next day, Manuel was benched in favor of veteran quarterback Kyle Orton after starting the first 4 games of the 2014 season and bringing the Bills a 2-2 record. Orton would win 7 of the next 12 games, finishing the Bills 2014 season 9-7, the first time the team had posted a winning record since 2004.          After posting the franchise's first winning record in a decade, Orton retired and Marrone opted out of the rest of his contract. The Bills then hired former division rival Rex Ryan as head coach. Manuel competed with free agent acquisition Tyrod Taylor and trade acquisition Matt Cassel for the starting quarterback job. During mini-camp, Manuel struggled to compete for the starting job and was listed as the number three quarterback on the depth chart. Manuel performed well in the third preseason game, completing nearly all of his passes, showing he had improved his accuracy. On August 31, 2015 coach Rex Ryan announced that Manuel and Matt Cassel lost the starting job to Tyrod Taylor.          Manuel made his first start in over a year week 6 against the undefeated Cincinnati Bengals in place of injured Tyrod Taylor, who suffered a MCL injury the previous week. On the first drive of the game for the Bills against the Bengals, Manuel led the Bills 80 yards down the field for a touchdown. Manuel finished with a stat line of 28-for-42, 263 passing yards, a passing touchdown, one touchdown rushing, and an interception in the 34-21 loss.          Against the Jacksonville Jaguars on October 25 in London, Manuel threw for 298 yards and 2 touchdowns but had 3 costly turnovers, two of which were returned directly for scores by the Jacksonville defense in the second quarter. He rallied the Bills from 24 points down to take the lead in the 4th. However, Jacksonville regained the lead with a Blake Bortles touchdown pass to Allen Hurns, sealing the win 34-31 as the Bills were unable to respond. With the loss, Manuel became the first NFL quarterback to lose a game in three different countries (United States, Canada, England).          On May 2, 2016, it was announced that the Buffalo Bills declined to exercise his fifth-year option for the 2017 season.          It was reported that Manuel would be offering stock in his future earnings via a venture with Fantex, Inc. as part of a new financial instrument being sold by Fantex. Manuel planned on offering a 10% share of all future earnings from his brand to Fantex, which would then turn around and divide it into shares of a publicly traded tracking stock.          In July 2014, the Manuel/Fantex stock offering was completed. 523,700 shares were sold, valued at $10 per share.","['1990 births', 'Living people', 'African-American players of American football', 'Sportspeople from Virginia Beach, Virginia', 'Players of American football from Virginia', 'Under Armour All-American football players', 'American football quarterbacks', 'Florida State Seminoles football players', 'Buffalo Bills players']"
2898955,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2898955,Pithoragarh district,"Pithoragarh district () is the easternmost Himalayan district in the state of Uttarakhand, India. It is naturally landscaped with high Himalayan mountains, snow-capped peaks, passes, valleys, alpine meadows, forests, waterfalls, perennial rivers, glaciers, and springs. The flora and fauna of the area have rich ecological diversity. Pithoragarh has many temples and ruined forts from the once flourishing reign of the warrior Chand Kingdom.          The geographical area of the district is . At the 2011 census, the total population of the district was 485,993. The total literacy rate was 82.93 percent. Pithoragarh town, which is located in Saur Valley (), is its headquarters. The district is within the Kumaon division () of Uttarakhand state. The Tibet plateau is situated to the north and Nepal is to the east. The Kali River originates from Kalapaani and flows south, forming the eastern border with Nepal. The Hindu pilgrimage route for Mount Kailash-Lake Manasarovar passes through this district via Lipulekh Pass in the greater Himalayas. The district is administratively divided into five tehsils: Munsiyari; Dharchula; Didihat; Gangolihat; and Pithoragarh. Naini Saini Airport is the nearest civil airport, but it does not have regular scheduled commercial passenger service. The mineral deposits present in the district are magnesium ore, copper ore, limestone, and slate.          Some attribute the name to King Pithora Chand from the Chand Dynasty, while others cite Prithvi Raj Chauhan of the Chauhan Rajputs, who built a fort named Pithora Garh in the Saur Valley.          After its conquest by Bhartpal, the Rajwar of Uku (now in Nepal), in the year 1364, Pithoragarh was ruled for the rest of the 14th century by three generations of Pals, and the kingdom extended from Pithoragarh to Askot.          According to a ""tamrapatra"" (inscribed copper or brass plaque) from 1420, the Pal dynasty, based out of Askot, was uprooted by Chand kings. Vijay Brahm (of the Brahm dynasty from Doti) took over the empire as King. Following the death of Gyan Chand, in a conflict with Kshetra Pal, the Pals were able to regain the throne.          It is believed that Bharti Chand, an ancestor of Gyan Chand, had replaced Bams, the ruler of Pithoragarh, after defeating them in 1445. In the 16th century, the Chand dynasty again took control over Pithoragarh town and, in 1790, built a new fort on the hill where the present Girls Inter College is situated. This fort was destroyed by the Indian government in 1962 after China attacked India.          The Chand rule, at its zenith, is seen as one of the most prominent empires in Kumaon.

On 8 March 2013, the Beechcraft 1900C-1 serving the flight, registration N116AX, crashed into a mountain on approach to Dillingham Municipal Airport, killing both crew members operating the flight.          The aircraft, a Beechcraft 1900C-1, serial number UC-17 registered N116AX, was manufactured in 1992, and ACE Air Cargo was its only operator, accumulating a total of 29,824 hours before the accident. The aircraft was powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-65B engines and was equipped for flight into icy conditions, but did not carry a cockpit voice recorder or flight data recorder.          The crew on this flight consisted of only the cockpit crew, 38-year-old Captain Jeff Day and 21-year-old First Officer Neil Jensen with 5,770 flight hours and 470 flight hours, respectively.          The flight had originally taken off from Anchorage International Airport at approximately 5:44 Alaska Standard Time, making a scheduled stop at King Salmon and continuing to Dillingham. En-route to Dillingham, the crew requested a RNAV GPS 19 instrument approach, which was granted by the on-duty controller who directed the crew to maintain an altitude at or above . Roughly six minutes later, the crew requested permission to enter into a holding pattern to contact the flight service station for a report on the condition of the runway, which was subsequently granted. The controllers later attempted to contact the aircraft, but were unsuccessful and soon lost radar track of the aircraft, which had crashed at Muklung Hills.          The aircraft hit the ground in a mountainous area called the Muklung Hills. This was the same area where, in 2010, an aircraft carrying nine people crashed; the passengers included former US Senator Ted Stevens, who was one of the five killed, and former NASA administrator Sean O'Keefe, who was one of the four survivors. The rescue operation to reach Flight 51 was carried out by the Alaska Air National Guard, Alaska State Troopers, and United States Coast Guard. The first rescue unit to reach the crash site was an Alaska Air National Guard helicopter, which was unable to land or lower rescuers due to poor weather conditions.          The accident was investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) who concluded that the plane crashed due to pilot error.","['2013 in Alaska', 'Airliner accidents and incidents in Alaska', 'Aviation accidents and incidents in the United States in 2013', 'Dillingham Census Area, Alaska']"

In the case of Sindh, there were three direct instances of governor's rule under Mian Aminuddin, Rahimuddin Khan and Moinuddin Haider respectively, in 1951-1953, 1988, and 1998 when the provincial chief ministers of those times were removed and assemblies dissolved.

Greer was born in Long Branch, New Jersey, and played with Elmer Snowden's band and the Howard Theatre's orchestra in Washington, D.C. before joining Duke Ellington, whom he met in 1919. He was Ellington's first drummer, playing with his quintet, the Washingtonians, and moving with Ellington into the Cotton Club. As a result of his job as a designer with the Leedy Drum Company of Indiana, Greer was able to build up a huge drum kit worth over a then-considerable $3,000, including chimes, a gong, timpani, and vibes.          Greer was a heavy drinker, as well as a pool-hall hustler (when he needed to retrieve his drums from the pawnbroker), and in 1950 Ellington responded to his drinking and occasional unreliability by taking a second drummer, Butch Ballard, with them on a tour of Scandinavia. This enraged Greer, and the consequent argument led to their permanent estrangement.          Greer continued to play, mainly as a freelance drummer, working with musicians such as Johnny Hodges, Red Allen, J. C. Higginbotham, Tyree Glenn, and Brooks Kerr, as well as appearing in films, and briefly leading his own band.

25090575,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25090575,Taenia taeniaeformis,"Taenia taeniaeformis is a parasitic tapeworm, with cats as the primary definitive hosts. Sometime dogs can also be the definitive host. The intermediate hosts of this tapeworm are primarily rodents and less frequently lagomorphs (rabbits) which the cat must kill and ingest their liver in order to acquire the tapeworm infection. The worm tends to be white, thick bodied, and around 15 to 60 cm in length. This species of tape worm is much less frequently encountered than ""Dipylidium caninum"", which has fleas as its intermediate host rather than rodents but exhibits most of the same physical characteristics and is treated with the same medications (i.e., antihelminthics).          The definitive host must ingest the strobilocercus stage of the tapeworm in order to acquire the parasite. The strobilocercus is a larval stage that has a terminal bladder and a rather long segmented body that is in crowned with the scolex that looks very similar to that found on the adult form. It seems that the strobilocercus must attain an age of about 2 months before it is in infective to a cat upon ingestion. Once a cat ingests the strobilocercus, the posterior portion of the larva is in digested away and then the anterior portion begins to develop. Infection in the cat will develop and become obvious between 30 and 80 days after the cat has ingested the infected liver of a prey animal. Once the infection is established, it can last for between seven months and three years. A cat will produce between three and four motile segments per day either excreted in the feces or through direct migration, each containing between 500 and 12,000 eggs. Spontaneous worm destrobilization (the shedding of the entire portion of the body located behind the scolex and containing all of the strobila) may occur without any change in actual infection. Once shed, the proglotids are often very active and are capable of crawling considerable distances as they shed their eggs. Actual eggs are spheroid and are between 31 and 36 micrometers in diameter. Superinfection in cats is possible if they are fed young tapeworms in the presence of established mature ones.          Infection in cats is in diagnosed by finding the distinctive segments in the feces or by finding the eggs upon fecal flotation. You may also see small segments lying around where the animal has been that have exited through the anus. To identify a segment, it can be crushed on a glass slide and examined for eggs.          Praziquantel (5 mg/kg body weight) and epsiprantel have both been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of taeniataeniaeformis in cats. Similarly, febantel and fenbendazole are approved for the treatment of this parasite in most of the world. Mebendazole and nitroscanate are also products that have efficacy against taeniataeniaeformis in cats.",['Cestoda']
299592,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=299592,Optical disc drive,"In computing, an optical disc drive (ODD) is a disk drive that uses laser light or electromagnetic waves within or near the visible light spectrum as part of the process of reading or writing data to or from optical discs. Some drives can only read from certain discs, but recent drives can both read and record, also called burners or writers. Compact discs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs are common types of optical media which can be read and recorded by such drives. Optical disc drives that are no longer in production include CD-ROM drive, CD writer drive, and combo (CD-RW/DVD-ROM) drive. As of 2015, DVD writer drive is the most common for desktop PCs and laptops. There are also the DVD-ROM drive, BD-ROM drive, Blu-ray Disc combo (BD-ROM/DVD±RW/CD-RW) drive, and Blu-ray Disc writer drive.          Optical disc drives are an integral part of standalone appliances such as CD players, VCD players, DVD players, Blu-ray disc players, DVD recorders, certain desktop video game consoles, such as Sony PlayStation 4, Microsoft Xbox One, Nintendo Wii U, and Sony PlayStation 3, and certain portable video game consoles, such as Sony PlayStation Portable. They are also very commonly used in computers to read software and consumer media distributed on disc, and to record discs for archival and data exchange purposes. Floppy disk drives, with capacity of 1.44 MB, have been made obsolete: optical media are cheap and have vastly higher capacity to handle the large files used since the days of floppy discs, and the vast majority of computers and much consumer entertainment hardware have optical writers. USB flash drives, high-capacity, small, and inexpensive, are suitable where read/write capability is required.          Disc recording is restricted to storing files playable on consumer appliances (films, music, etc.), relatively small volumes of data (e.g., a standard DVD holds 4.7 gigabytes) for local use, and data for distribution, but only on a small scale; mass-producing large numbers of identical discs is cheaper and faster than individual recording.          Optical discs are used to back up relatively small volumes of data, but backing up of entire hard drives, which typically contain many hundreds of gigabytes or even multiple terabytes, is less practical. Large backups are often instead made on external hard drives, as their price has dropped to a level making this viable; in professional environments magnetic tape drives are also used.          The first laser disc, demonstrated in 1972, was the ""Laservision"" 12-inch video disc. The video signal was stored as an analog format like a video cassette. The first digitally recorded optical disc was a 5-inch audio compact disc (CD) in a read-only format created by Philips and Sony in 1975. Five years later, the same two companies introduced a digital storage solution for computers using this same CD size called a CD-ROM. Not until 1987 did Sony demonstrate the erasable and rewritable 5.25-inch optical drive.          The most important part of an optical disc drive is an ""optical path"", placed in a ""pickup head"" (""PUH""), usually consisting of semiconductor laser, a lens for guiding the laser beam, and photodiodes detecting the light reflection from disc's surface.          Initially, CD lasers with a wavelength of 780 nm were used, being within infrared range. For DVDs, the wavelength was reduced to 650 nm (red color), and the wavelength for Blu-ray Disc was reduced to 405 nm (violet color).          Two main servomechanisms are used, the first one to maintain a correct distance between lens and disc, and ensure the laser beam is focused on a small ""laser spot"" on the disc. The second servo moves a head along the disc's radius, keeping the beam on a ""groove"", a continuous spiral data path.          On ""read only media"" (ROM), during the manufacturing process the groove, made of ""pits"", is pressed on a flat surface, called ""land"". Because the depth of the pits is approximately one-quarter to one-sixth of the laser's wavelength, the reflected beam's phase is shifted in relation to the incoming reading beam, causing mutual destructive interference and reducing the reflected beam's intensity. This is detected by photodiodes that output electrical signals.          A recorder encodes (or ""burns"") data onto a recordable CD-R, DVD-R, DVD+R, or BD-R disc (called a ""blank"") by selectively heating parts of an organic dye layer with a laser. This changes the reflectivity of the dye, thereby creating marks that can be read like the pits and lands on pressed discs. For recordable discs, the process is permanent and the media can be written to only once. While the reading laser is usually not stronger than 5 mW, the writing laser is considerably more powerful. The higher the writing speed, the less time a laser has to heat a point on the media, thus its power has to increase proportionally. DVD burners' lasers often peak at about 200 mW, either in continuous wave and pulses, although some have been driven up to 400 mW before the diode fails.          For rewritable CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-RAM, or BD-RE media, the laser is used to melt a crystalline metal alloy in the recording layer of the disc. Depending on the amount of power applied, the substance may be allowed to melt back (change the phase back) into crystalline form or left in an amorphous form, enabling marks of varying reflectivity to be created.          ""Double-sided"" media may be used, but they are not easily accessed with a standard drive, as they must be physically turned over to access the data on the other side.          ""Double layer"" (DL) media have two independent data layers separated by a semi-reflective layer. Both layers are accessible from the same side, but require the optics to change the laser's focus. Traditional ""single layer"" (SL) writable media are produced with a spiral groove molded in the protective polycarbonate layer (not in the data recording layer), to lead and synchronize the speed of recording head. Double-layered writable media have: a first polycarbonate layer with a (shallow) groove, a first data layer, a semi-reflective layer, a second (spacer) polycarbonate layer with another (deep) groove, and a second data layer. The first groove spiral usually starts on the inner edge and extends outwards, while the second groove starts on the outer edge and extends inwards.          Some drives support Hewlett-Packard's LightScribe photothermal printing technology for labeling specially coated discs.          The rotational mechanism in an optical drive differs considerably from that of a hard disk drive's, in that the latter keeps a constant angular velocity (CAV), in other words a constant number of revolutions per minute (RPM). With CAV, a higher throughput is generally achievable at the outer disc compared to the inner.          On the other hand, optical drives were developed with an assumption of achieving a constant throughput, in CD drives initially equal to 150 KiB/s. It was a feature important for streaming audio data that always tend to require a constant bit rate. But to ensure no disc capacity was wasted, a head had to transfer data at a maximum linear rate at all times too, without slowing on the outer rim of disc. This led to optical drives—until recently—operating with a constant linear velocity (CLV). The spiral ""groove"" of the disc passed under its head at a constant speed. The implication of CLV, as opposed to CAV, is that disc angular velocity is no longer constant, and the spindle motor needed to be designed to vary its speed from between 200 RPM on the outer rim and 500 RPM on the inner.          Later CD drives kept the CLV paradigm, but evolved to achieve higher rotational speeds, popularly described in multiples of a base speed. As a result, a 4× drive, for instance, would rotate at 800-2000 RPM, while transferring data steadily at 600 KiB/s, which is equal to 4 × 150 KiB/s.          For DVDs, base or 1× speed is 1.385 MB/s, equal to 1.32 MiB/s, approximately 9 times faster than the CD base speed. For Blu-ray drives, base speed is 6.74 MB/s, equal to 6.43 MiB/s.           Because keeping a constant transfer rate for the whole disc is not so important in most contemporary CD uses, a pure CLV approach had to be abandoned to keep the rotational speed of the disc safely low while maximizing data rate. Some drives work in a partial CLV (PCLV) scheme, by switching from CLV to CAV only when a rotational limit is reached. But switching to CAV requires considerable changes in hardware design, so instead most drives use the zoned constant linear velocity (Z-CLV) scheme. This divides the disc into several zones, each having its own constant linear velocity. A Z-CLV recorder rated at ""52×"", for example, would write at 20× on the innermost zone and then progressively increase the speed in several discrete steps up to 52× at the outer rim. Without higher rotational speeds, increased read performance may be attainable by simultaneously reading more than one point of a data groove, but drives with such mechanisms are more expensive, less compatible, and very uncommon.          Both DVDs and CDs have been known to explode when damaged and/or spun at excessive speed. This imposes a constraint on the maximum speed (56× for CDs or around 18× in the case of DVDs) at which drives can operate.          Current optical drives use either a ""tray-loading"" mechanism, where the disc is loaded onto a motorized or manually operated tray, or a ""slot-loading"" mechanism, where the disc is slid into a slot and drawn in by motorized rollers. With both types of mechanism, if a CD or DVD is left in the drive after the computer is turned off, the disc cannot be ejected using the normal eject mechanism of the drive. However, tray-loading drives account for this situation by providing a small hole where one can insert a straightened paperclip to manually open the drive tray to retrieve the disc. Slot-loading optical disc drives have the disadvantages that they cannot usually accept the smaller 80 mm discs (unless 80 mm optical disc adapter is used) or any non-standard sizes, usually have no emergency eject hole or eject button, and therefore have to be disassembled if the optical disc cannot be ejected normally. However, the Nintendo Wii, because of backwards compatibility with Nintendo GameCube games, and PlayStation 3 video game consoles are able to load standard size DVDs and 80 mm discs in the same slot-loading drive.          A small number of drive models, mostly compact portable units, have a ""top-loading"" mechanism where the drive lid is opened upwards and the disc is placed directly onto the spindle (for example, all PlayStation One consoles, portable CD players, and some standalone CD recorders all feature top-loading drives). These sometimes have the advantage of using spring-loaded ball bearings to hold the disc in place, minimizing damage to the disc if the drive is moved while it is spun up.          Some early CD-ROM drives used a mechanism where CDs had to be inserted into special cartridges or caddies, somewhat similar in appearance to a 3.5"" floppy diskette. This was intended to protect the disc from accidental damage by enclosing it in a tougher plastic casing, but did not gain wide acceptance due to the additional cost and compatibility concerns—such drives would also inconveniently require ""bare"" discs to be manually inserted into an openable caddy before use. Ultra Density Optical and Universal Media Disc use optical disc cartridges.          There were also some early CD-ROM drives for desktop PCs in which its tray-loading mechanism will eject slightly and user has to pull out the tray manually to load CD, similar to the tray ejecting method used in internal optical disc drives of modern laptops and modern external slim portable optical disc drives. Like the top-loading mechanism, they have spring-loaded ball bearings on the spindle.          Most internal drives for personal computers, servers and workstations are designed to fit in a standard 5.25"" drive bay and connect to their host via an ATA or SATA interface. Additionally, there may be digital and analog outputs for audio. The outputs may be connected via a header cable to the sound card or the motherboard. At one time, computer software resembling cd players controlled playback of the CD. Today the information is extracted from the disc as data, to be played back or converted to other file formats.          External drives usually have USB or FireWire interfaces. Some portable versions for laptops power themselves from batteries or directly from their interface bus.          Drives with SCSI interface were made, but they are less common and tend to be more expensive, because of the cost of their interface chipsets, more complex SCSI connectors, and small volume of sales.          When the optical disc drive was first developed, it was not easy to add to computer systems. Some computers such as the IBM PS/2 were standardizing on the 3.5"" floppy and 3.5"" hard disk, and did not include a place for a large internal device. Also IBM PCs and clones at first only included a single (parallel) ATA drive interface, which by the time the CDROM was introduced, was already being used to support two hard drives. Early laptops simply had no built-in high-speed interface for supporting an external storage device.          This was solved through several techniques:          The optical drives in the photos are shown right side up; the disc would sit on top of them. The laser and optical system scans the underside of the disc.          With reference to the top photo, just to the right of image center is the disc motor, a metal cylinder, with a gray centering hub and black rubber drive ring on top. There is a disc-shaped round clamp, loosely held inside the cover and free to rotate; it's not in the photo. After the disc tray stops moving inward, as the motor and its attached parts rise, a magnet near the top of the rotating assembly contacts and strongly attracts the clamp to hold and center the disc. This motor is an ""outrunner""-style brushless DC motor which has an external rotor – every visible part of it spins.          Two parallel guide rods that run between upper left and lower right in the photo carry the ""sled"", the moving optical read-write head. As shown, this ""sled"" is close to, or at the position where it reads or writes at the edge of the disc. To move the ""sled"" during continuous read or write operations, a stepper motor rotates a leadscrew to move the ""sled"" throughout its total travel range. The motor, itself, is the short gray cylinder just to the left of the most-distant shock mount; its shaft is parallel to the support rods. The leadscrew is the rod with evenly-spaced darker details; these are the helical grooves that engage a pin on the ""sled"".          In contrast, the mechanism shown in the second photo, which comes from a cheaply made DVD player, uses less accurate and less efficient brushed DC motors to both move the sled and spin the disc. Some older drives use a DC motor to move the sled, but also have a magnetic rotary encoder to keep track of the position. Most drives in computers use stepper motors.          The gray metal chassis is shock-mounted at its four corners to reduce sensitivity to external shocks, and to reduce drive noise from residual imbalance when running fast. The soft shock mount grommets are just below the brass-colored screws at the four corners (the left one is obscured).          In the third photo, the components under the cover of the lens mechanism are visible. The two permanent magnets on either side of the lens holder as well as the coils that move the lens can be seen. This allows the lens to be moved up, down, forwards, and backwards to stabilize the focus of the beam.          In the fourth photo, the inside of the optics package can be seen. Note that since this is a CD-ROM drive, there is only one laser, which is the black component mounted to the bottom left of the assembly. Just above the laser are the first focusing lens and prism that direct the beam at the disc. The tall, thin object in the center is a half-silvered mirror that splits the laser beam in multiple directions. To the bottom right of the mirror is the main photodiode that senses the beam reflected off the disc. Above the main photodiode is a second photodiode that is used to sense and regulate the power of the laser.          The irregular orange material is flexible etched copper foil supported by thin sheet plastic; these are ""flexible printed circuits"" that connect everything to the electronics (which is not shown).          Most optical drives are backwards compatible with their ancestors up to CD, although this is not required by standards.          Compared to a CD's 1.2 mm layer of polycarbonate, a DVD's laser beam only has to penetrate 0.6 mm in order to reach the recording surface. This allows a DVD drive to focus the beam on a smaller spot size and to read smaller pits. DVD lens supports a different focus for CD or DVD media with same laser. With the newer Blu-ray disc drives, the laser only has to penetrate 0.1 mm of material. Thus the optical assembly would normally have to have an even greater focus range. In practice, the Blu-ray optical system is separate from the DVD/CD system.          During the times of CD writer drives, they are often marked with three different speed ratings. In these cases, the first speed is for write-once (R) operations, the second speed for re-write (RW) operations, and the last speed for read-only (ROM) operations. For example, a 40×/16×/48× CD writer drive is capable of writing to CD-R media at speed of 40× (6,000 KB/s), writing to CD-RW media at speed of 16× (2,400 KB/s), and reading from a CD-ROM media at speed of 48× (7,200 KB/s).          During the times of combo (CD-RW/DVD-ROM) drives, an additional speed rating (e.g., the 16× in 52×/32×/52×/16×) is designated for DVD-ROM media reading operations.          For DVD writer drives, Blu-ray disc combo drives, and Blu-ray disc writer drives, the writing and reading speed of their respective optical media are specified in its retail box, user's manual, and/or bundled brochures or pamphlets.          In the late 1990s, ""buffer underruns"" became a very common problem as high-speed CD recorders began to appear in home and office computers, which—for a variety of reasons—often could not muster the I/O performance to keep the data stream to the recorder steadily fed. The recorder, should it run short, would be forced to halt the recording process, leaving a truncated track that usually renders the disc useless.          In response, manufacturers of CD recorders began shipping drives with ""buffer underrun protection"" (under various trade names, such as Sanyo's ""BURN-Proof"", Ricoh's ""JustLink"" and Yamaha's ""Lossless Link""). These can suspend and resume the recording process in such a way that the gap the stoppage produces can be dealt with by the error-correcting logic built into CD players and CD-ROM drives. The first of these drives were rated at 12× and 16×.          While drives are burning DVD+R, DVD+RW and all Blu-ray formats, they do not require any such error correcting recovery as the recorder is able to place the new data exactly on the end of the suspended write effectively producing a continuous track (this is what the DVD+ technology achieved). Although later interfaces were able to stream data at the required speed, many drives now write in a 'zoned constant linear velocity'. This means that the drive has to temporarily suspend the write operation while it changes speed and then recommence it once the new speed is attained. This is handled in the same manner as a buffer underrun.          The internal buffer of optical disc writer drives is: 8 MiB when recording BD-R/BD-R DL/BD-RE/BD-RE DL media; 2 MiB when recording DVD-R/DVD-RW/DVD-R DL/DVD+R/DVD+RW/DVD+RW DL/DVD-RAM/CD-R/CD-RW media.          CD recording on personal computers was originally a batch-oriented task in that it required specialised authoring software to create an ""image"" of the data to record, and to record it to disc in the one session. This was acceptable for archival purposes, but limited the general convenience of CD-R and CD-RW discs as a removable storage medium.          Packet writing is a scheme in which the recorder writes incrementally to disc in short bursts, or packets. Sequential packet writing fills the disc with packets from bottom up. To make it readable in CD-ROM and DVD-ROM drives, the disc can be ""closed"" at any time by writing a final table-of-contents to the start of the disc; thereafter, the disc cannot be packet-written any further. Packet writing, together with support from the operating system and a file system like UDF, can be used to mimic random write-access as in media like flash memory and magnetic disks.          Fixed-length packet writing (on CD-RW and DVD-RW media) divides up the disc into padded, fixed-size packets. The padding reduces the capacity of the disc, but allows the recorder to start and stop recording on an individual packet without affecting its neighbours. These resemble the block-writable access offered by magnetic media closely enough that many conventional file systems will work as-is. Such discs, however, are not readable in most CD-ROM and DVD-ROM drives or on most operating systems without additional third-party drivers. The division into packets is not as reliable as it may seem as CD-R(W) and DVD-R(W) drives can only locate data to within a data block. Although generous gaps (the padding referred to above) are left between blocks, the drive nevertheless can occasionally miss and either destroy some existing data or even render the disc unreadable.          The DVD+RW disc format eliminates this unreliability by embedding more accurate timing hints in the data groove of the disc and allowing individual data blocks (or even bytes) to be replaced without affecting backwards compatibility (a feature dubbed ""lossless linking""). The format itself was designed to deal with discontinuous recording because it was expected to be widely used in digital video recorders. Many such DVRs use variable-rate video compression schemes which require them to record in short bursts; some allow simultaneous playback and recording by alternating quickly between recording to the tail of the disc whilst reading from elsewhere. The Blu-ray disc system also encompasses this technology.          Mount Rainier aims to make packet-written CD-RW and DVD+RW discs as convenient to use as that of removable magnetic media by having the firmware format new discs in the background and manage media defects (by automatically mapping parts of the disc which have been worn out by erase cycles to reserve space elsewhere on the disc). As of February 2007, support for Mount Rainier is natively supported in Windows Vista. All previous versions of Windows require a third-party solution, as does Mac OS X.          Owing to pressure from the music industry, as represented by the IFPI and RIAA, Philips developed the ""Recorder Identification Code"" (RID) to allow media to be uniquely associated with the recorder that has written it. This standard is contained in the Rainbow Books. The RID-Code consists of a supplier code (e.g. ""PHI"" for Philips), a model number and the unique ID of the recorder. Quoting Philips, the RID ""enables a trace for each disc back to the exact machine on which it was made using coded information in the recording itself. The use of the RID code is mandatory.""          Although the RID was introduced for music and video industry purposes, the RID is included on every disc written by every drive, including data and backup discs. The value of the RID is questionable as it is (currently) impossible to locate any individual recorder due to there being no database.          The Source IDentification Code (SID) is an eight character supplier code that is placed on optical discs by the manufacturer. The SID identifies not only manufacturer, but also the individual factory and machine that produced the disc.          According to Phillips, the administrator of the SID codes, the SID code provides an optical disc production facility with the means to identify all discs mastered and/or replicated in its plant, including the specific Laser Beam Recorder (LBR) signal processor or mould that produced a particular stamper or disc.          The standard use of RID and SID mean that each disc written contains a record of the machine that produced a disc (the SID), and which drive wrote it (the RID). This combined knowledge may be very useful to law enforcement, to investigative agencies, and to private and/or corporate investigators.","['American inventions', 'Audio storage', 'Optical computer storage', 'Optoelectronics', 'Video storage']"

14852221,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14852221,Isolationist (comics),"The Isolationist (Josef Huber) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by Peter David and Pablo Raimondi. The character's first appearance was in ""X-Factor"" vol. 1, #89 on a single page, but his story wasn't continued until ""X-Factor"" vol. 3 #16, fifteen years later.          Isolationist is a German telepath who convinced Jamie Madrox, Beast, and Cyclops to organize a ""Million Mutant March"" political rally to get mutants declared an endangered species by the United States government. However, Layla Miller told Madrox that one of Huber's agents had tried to kill her, and it was revealed that Huber's plan was a plot to get all the mutants in one place so they could be destroyed. Huber claimed that all the mutant voices in his head were driving him crazy and that had manipulated and arranged all of X-Factor Investigations' problems and adventures. Then he teleported the team to a frozen wasteland.          He also somehow arranged for a young French girl named Nicole (actually an android created by Huber) to be taken in by M and Siryn in Paris, seemingly of their own free will, despite later stating that M and Siryn are immune to his telepathic suggestions.          When Layla Miller survived a murder attempt by Nicole (thanks to a mentally unstable Quicksilver's intervention), Huber's plans came undone. Layla warned Madrox about Huber, who then fought Madrox, Strong Guy, and Wolfsbane. Huber teleported the three to the Antarctic. They were then out of communication range of M and Siryn, who were busy on a case, which had also been arranged by Huber, with the aid of a family of mutant haters. M became worried and flew back to X-Factor headquarters, arriving just in time to stop Huber from smashing Rictor with a car. Rictor had been more or less successfully fighting Huber; Rictor was immune to the direct applications of Huber's mutant powers because Rictor was using Terrigen crystals he had left over from his time with Quicksilver. Huber had not foreseen this. Huber turned to sand and floated away, disdaining tedious fighting in favor of his planned genocide. He returned to his icy cave.          The Isolationist possesses the abilities of all living mutants on the planet or approximately two-hundred different mutant power sets. This would place him among the most powerful beings in the Marvel universe, although it is unclear how much he is hindered by his telepathy.          He has displayed the use of eye beams, ice beams, teleportation, steel skin and superhuman strength, and telepathy.           His abilities weaken the further he is away from mutants, though his ability of telepathy remains strong enough to disturb him even when he is in isolation. He has a weakness and inability to control his telepathy, and constantly hears the thoughts of people around the world.           Using a power he copied from Forge's technological-knack mutation, the Isolationist has created advanced devices including a teleporter and a lifelike robot.          He is unable to shut off his overwhelming mind-reading powers, even with his isolation and the use of pills, thus causing him constant misery as he reads the minds of people simultaneously throughout the world, forcing him to ingest large amounts of painkillers and depressants to dull his senses. The addition of a telepath close to his proximity is particularly disturbing to him.          His powers also create a mental block that prevents him from directly using his powers against mutants; as a result, while he can put them in situations that ""might"" kill them- such as when he created a portal to send X-Factor to the arctic regions where they would ""eventually"" freeze to death - he cannot simply destroy a mutant's mind with his telepathy or tear them apart with his physical strength.","['Comics characters introduced in 1993', 'Characters created by Peter David', 'Fictional inventors', 'Marvel Comics characters who can teleport', 'Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength', 'Marvel Comics supervillains', 'Marvel Comics telepaths']"
1805298,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1805298,Bugatti Type 35,"The Type 35 was the most successful of the Bugatti racing models. Its version of the Bugatti arch-shaped radiator that had evolved from the more architectural one of the Bugatti Type 13 Brescia, was to become the one that the marque is most known for though even in the ranks of the various Type 35s there were variations on the theme.          The Type 35 was phenomenally successful, winning over 1,000 races in its time. It took the Grand Prix World Championship in 1926 after winning 351 races and setting 47 records in the two prior years. At its height, Type 35s averaged 14 race wins per week. Bugatti won the Targa Florio for five consecutive years, from 1925 through 1929, with the Type 35.          The original model, introduced at the Grand Prix of Lyon on August 3, 1924, used an evolution of the 3-valve 2.0 L (1991 cc/121 in³) overhead cam straight-8 engine first seen on the Type 29. Bore was 60 mm and stroke was 88 mm as on many previous Bugatti models. Ninety-six examples were produced.          This new powerplant featured five main bearings with an unusual ball bearing system. This allowed the engine to rev to 6000 rpm, and 90 hp (67 kW) was reliably produced. Solid axles with leaf springs were used front and rear, and drum brakes at the back, operated by cables, were specified. Alloy wheels were a novelty, as was the hollow front axle for reduced unsprung weight. A second feature of the Type 35 that was to become a Bugatti trademark was passing the springs through the front axle rather than simply U-bolting them together as was done on their earlier cars.          A rare version was de-bored (to 52 mm) for a total displacement of 1.5 L (1494 cc/91 in³). There are two of these rare cars in New Zealand.          Dimensions:          A less expensive version of the Type 35 appeared in May, 1925. The factory's ""Type 35A"" name was ignored by the public, who nicknamed it ""Tecla"" after a famous maker of imitation jewelry. The Tecla's engine used three plain bearings, smaller valves, and coil ignition like the Type 30. While this decreased maintenance requirements, it also reduced output. One-hundred thirty nine of the Type 35As were sold.          The Type 35C featured a Roots supercharger, despite Ettore Bugatti's disdain for forced induction. Output was nearly 128 hp (95 kW) with a single Zenith carburettor. Type 35Cs won the French Grand Prix at Saint-Gaudens in 1928, and at Pau in 1930. Fifty examples left the factory.          For 1926, Bugatti introduced a special model for the Targa Florio race. Called the ""Type 35T"" officially, it soon became known as the ""Targa Florio"". Engine displacement was up to 2.3 L (2262 cc/138 in³) with a longer 100 mm stroke. Grand Prix rule changes limiting capacity to 2.0 L limited the appeal of this model at the time with just thirteen produced.          The final version of the Type 35 series was the Type 35B of 1927. Originally named ""Type 35TC"", it shared the 2.3 L engine of the Type 35T but added a large supercharger like the Type 35C. Output was 138 hp (102 kW), and 45 examples were made. A British racing green Type 35B driven by William Grover-Williams won the 1929 French Grand Prix at Le Mans.          The Type 35 chassis and body were reused on the Type 37 sports car. Fitted with a new 1.5 L (1496 cc/91 in³) straight-4 engine, 290 Type 37s were built. This engine was an SOHC three-valve design and produced 60 hp (44 kW). The same engine went on to be used in the Type 40.          The supercharged Type 37A accounted for 67 of the Type 37's production slots. Engine output was up to . It also had larger shrouded brake drums.          The Type 39 was basically identical to the Type 35C except for its engine. This was modified to be smaller at 1.5 L (1493 cc/91 in³) with a shorter-stroked crankshaft. This brought stroke down from 88 mm to 66 mm, and a mix of regular and ball bearings were used. Ten examples were produced.          An odd 1.1 L (1092 cc/66 in³) version was also created by reducing the bore of the engine to 51.3 mm.","['Bugatti automobiles', 'Grand Prix cars', '24 Hours of Le Mans race cars']"
41155972,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41155972,Ramón Saldívar,"Ramón Saldívar (born 1949) is a Mexican-American author, teacher and researcher of cultural studies and Chicano literature. He is currently a professor at Stanford University, and received the National Humanities Medal from President Barack Obama in 2012.          Saldívar grew up in Brownsville, Texas, a town on the Mexico-United States border. Saldívar said in an interview that “From downtown Brownsville, you can literally look across the river and, a hundred yards away or so, there’s Mexico. To me, growing up, that was always normal life, that was the way the world worked: bilingual, binational, transcultural in all sorts of ways.” He was raised in a Spanish speaking household, learning English only after entering school.          He graduated from Brownsville High School in 1968, and pursued undergraduate studies at the University of Texas, Austin. Saldívar briefly considered a career in law or a return to Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, but ultimately earned a degree in comparative literature and graduated with highest honors, and a membership in the Phi Beta Kappa Society. He went on to earn a Master of Philosophy from Yale University in 1975 and a Ph.D two years later.          After graduating from Yale, Saldívar spent 15 years teaching at UT Austin before accepting a position at Stanford in 1991. He has been a professor of English and Comparative Literature there for the past 22 years. Saldívar acted as Stanford’s Associate Dean and Vice-Provost for Undergraduate Studies from 1994 to 1999, and worked as a Milligan Family University Fellow in Undergraduate Education from 2002 to 2012. He is currently the director of Stanford’s Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity. Saldívar’s lectures cover topics in literary criticism and theory, the history of the novel, 19th and 20th-century literature, cultural studies, globalization and transnationalism, and Chicano/a studies.          In February 2012, Saldívar was one of nine scholars honored with a National Humanities Medal by United States President Barack Obama. After receiving the medal, Saldívar said he was both ""completely blown away and deeply moved by the honor.""          Saldívar has written three books, the first of which, ""Figural Language in the Novel: The Flowers of Speech from Cervantes to Joyce"", was published in 1984. In ""Figural Language in the Novel"", Saldívar states that a narrator’s primary duty is to employ a grammar and syntax for communicating both surreal and realistic experiences.          Saldívar’s second book, ""Chicano Narrative: The Dialectics of Difference"", was released in 1990 and focused on the struggle of Mexican-American authors to maintain cultural identity throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, a struggle which the author felt had been neglected in the study of American literature.          His most recent book, ""The Borderlands of Culture: Américo Paredes and the Transnational Imaginary"", focuses on Mexican-American scholar Américo Paredes and his contributions to the discourse of cultural studies in the U.S. Saldívar details a history of Paredes’ career in writing about the American southwestern borderlands, and presents Paredes as being among the founders of a new kind of cultural studies in America concerned with the Mexico-United States border and its social and historical significance. The book was published by Duke University Press in 2006, seven years after Paredes died.          Saldívar points out that unlike most ethnic immigrants in the United States, Mexican Americans became an ethnic minority through the direct conquest of their homelands. This change in legal status resulted in the slow development of a unique culture that was distinct from both Mexican and mainstream American Culture.          A focus of Saldívar’s work is the idea that Chicano literature has been relegated to ethnic studies more than it deserves. Saldívar believes that it should instead be considered American literature. “Works by Mexican-American authors are absent from the American literary histories, the anthologies of American literature, and from the syllabi of courses on American literature. Spanish departments in American universities have also participated in this strategy of exclusion,” he says. “This exclusion is by no means innocent.”          Much of that theory, presented in his book ""Chicano Narrative,"" has been met with support from other academics. Maria A. Beltran states in Vocal and American Literature that “Saldívar provides the reader with a more modern, challenging, and sophisticated critical view of Mexican-American literature.” “His aim is to educate Hispanic and non-Hispanic educators and scholars. His book may shock those who still deny that Chicano literature must be included in the teaching of Hispanic and American literature in U.S. colleges and universities, for he strives to demonstrate that, through their works, Chicano authors represent and are part of an American reality that can no longer be ignored.” Hector A. Torres of College Literature called Chicano Narrative “a monumental work on the scene of Chicano/a literary criticism.""          José E. Limón, in American Literary History, criticized Saldívar’s philosophy of Chicano/American integration and the existence of a defined dialectic, that Saldívar described in ""The Borderlands of Culture"" “Saldívar seems too determined to create such a substantial East–West, truly transnational Duboisian figure in Paredes when the available evidence would seem rather to suggest a Mexican-American intellectual of high achievement in two relatively discrete spheres,” he writes.          Saldívar has seven siblings, two of which have also gone on to become professors of literature. His brother, José, teaches at Stanford and his sister Sonia Saldívar-Hull teaches at the University of Texas San Antonio. Saldívar has said that Walt Whitman is his favorite poet, and believes that the contradictions and multitudes he presents in his poetry are similar to the themes used in Chicano literature. Saldívar grew up a self-proclaimed fan of Davy Crockett, but was conflicted when he found out that his hero fought against Mexican forces.","['1949 births', 'American academics', 'Living people', 'American people of Mexican descent', 'Stanford University faculty', 'University of Texas at Austin alumni', 'Yale University alumni', 'American male writers', 'National Humanities Medal recipients']"

Valentino is one of several women who have made public sexual-abuse allegations against Cosby Valentino was one of the five women interviewed in a ""Washington Post"" piece published on November 22, 2014, making her the sixteenth woman to come forward and speak out against Cosby. Valentino met Cosby shortly after the death of her son and claims that the comedian was trying to ""cheer"" her up over her loss. She was accompanied by her former roommate at the time, Meg Foster, and Cosby took the ladies to an apartment after dinner. According to Valentino, Cosby took advantage of her and Foster by drugging them with pills. From her recollection, Valentino noticed that Foster had passed out from the pills and that Cosby stood over Foster with an erection and a ""predatory"" look. ""It was very clear to me that he was going to assault her while she was asleep or unconscious,"" Valentino alleged. ""I reached out, grabbing him, trying to get his attention, trying to distract him. He came over to me and sat down on the love seat and opened his fly and grabbed my head and pushed my head down. And then he turned me over. It was like a waking nightmare."" Valentino states that she has difficulties speaking about her sexual encounter with Bill Cosby, moreover, she did not come forward at the time because she felt that she had ""little credibility.""

She is a three-time Olympian (2000, 2004, and 2008), and a daughter of Valentin Partõka, who competed in both 200 and 400 m individual medley at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, representing the Soviet Union.          Partoka made her first Estonian team, as a 17-year-old swimming teen at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. There, she failed to reach the semifinals in any of her individual events, finishing twenty-ninth in the 100 m freestyle (57.71), and thirty-first in the 200 m freestyle (2:05.90).          At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Partoka competed only in the 200 m freestyle. Swimming in heat three, she edged out New Zealand's Alison Fitch to earn a fourth spot and twenty-eighth overall by four hundredths of a second (0.04) in 2:03.54.

The game was designed for solitairy play (in fact it is one of the very first purpose-designed solitaire games released in box form), but there are rules for a two-player game. Game (mission) length can vary from 5 to 20 minutes depending on the target.          Several variants exist including a 15th Air Force theater variant along with aircraft variants that include the late-model Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress, the Consolidated B-24 Liberator, Royal Air Force Avro Lancaster and late-war Luftwaffe aircraft (including the Messerschmitt Me 262 and Messerschmitt Me 163 jet aircraft). This game is also adaptable to a more role-playing game style of play. These variants were released in periodicals such as The General Magazine.          Bombers and crews in this simulation suffer from high casualty rates. Only when long-range fighter escorts (specifically the North American P-51 Mustang) were deployed did the attrition rate for crew diminish. Until the deployment of long-range escorts, the bombers had to fight their way to the target and back (as in this simulation).          The game is dice-driven, and relies on charts and tables to determine outcomes. Player participation is minimal, as the game system picks the targets to be flown to, and the enemy opposition as well as a number of random events that might take place (representing damage or failure of equipment on the plane, navigational errors, etc.). Player participation is limited to allocating defensive fire from the multiple weapons positions on the bomber.          The game's missions take place between the early raids in 1942 and the costly deep-penetration raids of autumn 1943. This was the period in which the 8th Air Force was developing high-altitude daylight bombing strategy and tactics while a seasoned Luftwaffe took advantage of the 8th Air Force's lack of long-range fighter escort and experience. Even with the then top-secret Norden bomb sight and intimidating B-17 combat ""boxes"" (i.e. close formation flying to allow mutual protection for B-17s and more concentrated bombing patterns) flak, bad weather and determined Luftwaffe attacks resulted in only a few of the bombs hitting the target which is clearly represented in the simulation.","['Board games introduced in 1983', 'Avalon Hill games', 'World War II board wargames']"
564181,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=564181,The Church (band),"The Church are an Australian psychedelic rock band formed in Sydney in 1980. Initially associated with new wave, neo-psychedelia and indie rock, their music later came to feature slower tempos and surreal soundscapes reminiscent of dream pop and post-rock. Glenn A. Baker has written that ""From the release of the 'She Never Said' single in November 1980, this unique Sydney-originated entity has purveyed a distinctive, ethereal, psychedelic-tinged sound which has alternatively found favour and disfavor in Australia"". The ""Los Angeles Times"" has described the band's music as ""dense, shimmering, exquisite guitar pop"".          The founding members were Steve Kilbey on lead vocals and bass guitar, Peter Koppes and Marty Willson-Piper on guitars and Nick Ward on drums. Ward only played on their debut album and the band's drummer for the rest of the 1980s was Richard Ploog. Jay Dee Daugherty (ex-Patti Smith Group) played drums from 1990 to 1993, followed by Tim Powles (ex-The Venetians) who remains with them to the present day. Koppes left the band from 1992 to 1997 and Willson-Piper left in 2013. He was replaced by Ian Haug, formerly of Powderfinger. Kilbey, Koppes and Powles also recorded together as """" in 1997.          The Church's debut album, ""Of Skins and Heart"" (1981), delivered their first radio hit ""The Unguarded Moment"" and they were signed to major labels in Australia, Europe and the United States. However, the US label was dissatisfied with their second album and dropped the band without releasing it. This put a dent in their international success, but they returned to the charts in 1988, with the album ""Starfish"" and the US Top 40 hit ""Under the Milky Way"". Subsequent mainstream success has proved elusive, but the band retains a large international cult following and were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in Sydney in 2011. The Church continue to tour and record, releasing their 24th studio album, ""Further/Deeper"", in October 2014.          Singer, songwriter and bass guitarist Steve Kilbey first played with guitarist Peter Koppes in a glam rock band called Baby Grande in Canberra, Australia in the mid-1970s. After each had left to travel and play in other bands including Tactics (Kilbey) and Limazine (Koppes), they met again in Sydney in March 1980 and formed the initial three-piece version of The Church, with Limazine drummer Nick Ward. The name was a shortened version of the original name proposed by Kilbey: ""The Church of Man"". A month later, Marty Willson-Piper, originally from Liverpool, United Kingdom, witnessed one of their gigs and met Kilbey afterwards. That same night he was invited to join the band on guitar, establishing the classic two guitar formation.          A four-song demo was recorded in Kilbey's bedroom studio and sent, through contacts from his and Koppes's old band Baby Grande, to the Australian branch of The Beatles' publishing company, ATV Northern Songs. The song ""Chrome Injury"" attracted the attention of managing director Chris Gilbey, who signed the band to his recently formed record production company, in association with EMI and their recently resurrected Parlophone label. Gilbey went to band rehearsals and helped shape their sound – he bought Willson-Piper a 12 string Rickenbacker guitar and equipped Koppes with an Echolette tape delay. Of that first batch of demos, only ""Chrome Injury"" would go on to be recorded for release.          The band's debut album, ""Of Skins and Heart"", was recorded late in 1980, produced by Gilbey and mixed by Bob Clearmountain. Seven of the nine tracks were written solely by Kilbey and two co-written with others. The first single, ""She Never Said"", was released in November, but did not chart. At the start of 1981, Ward was replaced on drums by Richard Ploog. He was recruited by their manager, Michael Chugg, after hearing of his reputation in Adelaide. Ploog's arrival established The Church's first stable line-up. The second single ""The Unguarded Moment"", co-written by Kilbey and Michelle Parker, was issued alongside the album in March 1981, but only in Australia initially. ""The Unguarded Moment"" became an Australian top ten hit, reaching No. 22 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart, while ""Of Skins and Heart"" went gold, achieving the same position on the related Albums Chart. To promote their releases, the band undertook their first national tour.          The first recordings with Ploog were released as a five-track double 7"" EP, ""Too Fast for You"", in July. It included the first collectively written track, ""Sisters"". Another track, ""Tear It All Away"", later released as a separate single, showed a development towards the more elaborate guitar structures which would become part of their signature sound. Their image and sound now evoked comparisons with 1960s psychedelic groups, with tight jeans, paisley shirts and Byrds-style jangly guitars.          ""Of Skins and Heart""s commercial success enabled Gilbey to present the release to Freddie Cannon of French label Carrere and Rupert Perry of U.S. label Capitol. Both labels released the album in 1982, renaming it simply ""The Church"" and slightly altering the track listing to include songs from ""Too Fast for You"" and using a crop of that EP's artwork as the cover. ""The Church"" peaked at No. 7 in the New Zealand Albums Chart and No. 13 in Sweden. Ploog was incorrectly credited as the sole drummer on the release, despite only playing on one or three tracks, depending on the version. Capitol also released an edited single version of ""The Unguarded Moment"", without the band's approval.          The second album, ""The Blurred Crusade"", was issued in March 1982 and was both produced and mixed by Bob Clearmountain. Sonically and stylistically more complex than the debut, it is ""a smoother, fuller release"", which showed the clear influence of 1960s psychedelia. ""With its mystical lyrics the second album ... brought the group's own style more into focus"". The album peaked at No. 10 and its first single, ""Almost With You"" resulted in a second Top 30 hit, peaking at No. 21.          The Church undertook a second Australian tour, while Carrere released the album in Europe, generating enough sales for them to tour there in October. However, Capitol declined to release ""The Blurred Crusade"" in North America and demanded that they write more radio-friendly material, as exemplified by their stable-mates Little River Band, which horrified the band. After another recording session, five new songs were offered to Capitol but the label was still unimpressed and dropped the band. The five songs were later released in Australia as the EP ""Sing-Songs"", which reached the Top 100 Albums Chart in December. Meanwhile, their manager, Michael Chugg, arranged a U.K. tour supporting the hugely successful pop group Duran Duran, but after eight gigs The Church pulled out, feeling that the audiences were unsympathetic. Chugg later recalled, ""They were hard work. All four of them were strong-willed and had their own ideas of how things should be."" The band also toured Scandinavia and Europe in 1982, and both of their albums were released there to critical acclaim.          In May 1983, the band released their third album, ""Seance"", co-produced by The Church and engineer John Bee (Hoodoo Gurus, Icehouse, The Divinyls), which peaked at No. 18. It used more keyboards and synthesisers and was typically described as ""That stark release [which] explored the band's darker side, and [whose] tracks ... were awash with strings and other effects"". The accompanying live shows included a guest keyboardist, Melbourne-based session player Dean Walliss.          For ""Seance"" the band employed mixing engineer Nick Launay, who had worked with Midnight Oil. He favoured a gated reverb drum sound, popular in the 1980s, which produced a staccato-like snare sound. Unsatisfied with the sound, the band asked Launay to redo the mix, but the effect was only lightened. The first single, ""Electric Lash"" featured this effect especially prominently and it was likened to a ""machine gun"". Despite dissatisfaction over the mix, ""Seance"" featured a lusher, more atmospheric Church with highlights including ""Now I Wonder Why"" and ""Fly"". Internationally, the album sold poorly, being considered dark and cryptic, and the general public seemed to lose interest. Some critics in Europe and the U.S. did like the album however, with ""Creem"" hailing the band as ""one of the best in the world"".          ""Seance"" was again dominated by Kilbey's song writing. Some 20 songs were put together on his home 4-track. Only one band composition made the album: the experimental ""Travel by Thought"". Kilbey and Willson-Piper had co-written another track, ""10,000 Miles"", but the label rejected it. Kilbey was upset by the label's interference, finding the track essential to their live set (it would be included on their next EP). Despite the difficulties, the album yielded two minor hits - ""It's No Reason"" and ""Electric Lash"" - and stayed in the British independent charts for several months.          The band had built a devoted fan base with their paisley shirts, catchy melodies and solid live performances. Following the release of ""Seance"", they toured Australia and New Zealand for the rest of the year to pay off debts incurred on the European tour. Meanwhile, Capitol Records released their first album in Canada, where it reached the Top 20. The ""Sing-Songs"" EP also became one of the bestselling Canadian imports of 1983.          Foregoing a full album, the band released two EPs in 1984, ""Remote Luxury"" in March and ""Persia"" in August, but only in Australia and New Zealand. Both EPs reached the Top 50 on the Australian Albums Chart. Again, almost all tracks were written by Kilbey, but compared to ""Seance"", the atmosphere was lighter and less gloomy. The band's trademark guitar sound was complemented by the keyboards of guest musicians Davey Ray Moor (from The Crystal Set, which included Kilbey's brother Russell) and Craig Hooper (from The Reels), who joined as an auxiliary member. Hooper soon left to form The Mullanes.          The band then signed to Warner Bros. Records in the United States. Internationally the two EPs were repackaged as a single album titled ""Remote Luxury"". Its U.S. release was their first record there since the debut album – although ""The Blurred Crusade"" and ""Seance"" had sold well on import. Due to the interest raised in the U.S., they left Michael Chugg Management in Sydney and signed with Malibu Management's owner John Lee. They toured the USA in October and November and while venues in New York and Los Angeles saw audiences of about 1000 people, other gigs had as few as 50. In financial terms the tour went poorly and the band lost thousands of dollars a week.          The Church seemed to reach a nadir in 1984. Unable to repeat the commercial success of the first two albums, there was a perception that their creativity was declining. Kilbey later said: ""I think we released a few dud records that weren't as good as they should have been, after ""The Blurred Crusade"" ... The band was just drifting along in a sea of apathy, I was writing not-so-good songs and the band wasn't playing them very well, so everyone's enthusiasm just waned"".          The start of 1985 was quiet for the band as members spent time apart in Stockholm, Sydney and Jamaica. Kilbey's debut solo single, ""This Asphalt Eden"", was released by EMI Parlophone and he was also the producer on a single, ""Benefit of the Doubt"", for The Crystal Set.          The Church reconvened at Studios 301 in mid 1985 to work on their next album, ""Heyday"", with British producer/engineer Peter Walsh (Simple Minds, Scott Walker, Peter Gabriel). Their first single in almost two years, ""Already Yesterday"", appeared in October and just made the Top 100. ""Heyday"" followed in November and brought new stylistic elements with the addition of real strings and horns, creating a warm, organic sound. The songs ""were among the richest moments in The Church canon"". While Kilbey still wrote the lyrics, the band were now largely writing the music together, a practice which they would continue thereafter.          Released in Australia, New Zealand, Europe and the US, the album was warmly received. In Australia it peaked at No. 19, and appeared on the U.S. ""Billboard"" 200. A promotional tour started in April 1986, with concerts both at home and abroad. Unexpectedly, Willson-Piper suddenly quit mid-tour after rising in-band tensions and on 10 July, The Church performed as a three-piece in Hamburg, Germany. Willson-Piper returned within a week after Kilbey agreed that future releases would contain more group efforts.          Despite the charged atmosphere and warm press, low sales for the album's singles in Australia prompted EMI to drop them. Plans for a double live album, ""Bootleg"", were also scrapped. Since the band had greater sales overseas than in Australia, they decided to record in a studio abroad and opted for a four album deal with U.S. label Arista Records in 1987. For Australian releases they signed with Mushroom Records.          Recording sessions in Los Angeles, with producers Waddy Wachtel (Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones, Robbie Williams) and Greg Ladanyi (Warren Zevon, Jackson Browne, Fleetwood Mac), were a new challenge according to Kilbey, ""It was Australian hippies versus West Coast guys who know the way they like to do things. We were a bit more undisciplined than they would have liked"". Personality clashes occurred as the two sides bickered over guitar sounds, song structures and work ethic. Under pressure from the producers, Kilbey took vocal lessons, an experience he later regarded as valuable.          The stress of living in the US influenced their recording, and left Kilbey feeling out of place: Album tracks such as ""North, South, East and West,"" ""Lost,"" ""Reptile"" and ""Destination"" bore the imprint of the faces, scenery and daily life of the group's new, temporary home.          Four weeks of gruelling rehearsal resulted in ""Starfish"", which focused on capturing the band's core sound. Bright, spacious and uncluttered, the recording was a departure from the layered orchestrations of ""Heyday"". The group wanted as live and dynamic an album as possible, Willson-Piper said that trying to record a live atmosphere lacked a real gig's sense of ""being there"". They found the results bare and simplistic; however, the public reception was unexpected.          Released in February 1988, ""Starfish"" found its way into the mainstream, marking a new worldwide commercial peak for the band. It reached No. 11 in Australia and Top 50 in the US. The album was awarded a gold record in December 1992 by the Recording Industry Association of America. Also released in February, the single ""Under the Milky Way"" reached #24 on the US Hot 100, #22 in Australia and entered the Canadian Top 100. It peaked at No. 2 on the ""Billboard"" Mainstream Rock Tracks. The track was written by Kilbey and then-girlfriend Karin Jansson (ex-Pink Champagne). A near-five minute video received airtime on music television programs. ""Under the Milky Way"" won an ARIA Award in 1989 for 'Single of the Year'. In 2008, readers of ""The Australian"" voted it the best Australian song of the last 20 years. In response Kilbey said, ""it's not really about anything at all. I just wanted to create an atmosphere and I didn't even put a lot of thought into that. History has given it something that it never really had"".          A second single from ""Starfish"", ""Reptile"", charted on the Australian Top 100 in August and ""Billboard"" Mainstream charts.          EMI responded with a double compilation album, ""Hindsight 1980-1987"", which contained selections from the band's previous albums, together with hitherto-uncollected singles and B-sides. It peaked in the ARIA Top 40 Albums Chart in July.          The Church promoted ""Starfish"" with a nine-month tour before they returned to the studio for a follow-up. With a US Top 50 album under their belt, there was pressure from Arista to create another. The band started negotiations with former Led Zeppelin bass guitarist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, who had a reputation as a sophisticated producer, but the record company and management vetoed their suggestion. In an attempt to duplicate the success of ""Starfish"", The Church returned to Los Angeles with Waddy Wachtel producing.          While the previous sessions were tense, these were volatile. Already unenthusiastic about the forced pairing, there was the stress of having to create another hit album, and this took its toll. All members were outspoken about the role that drugs played in The Church’s creative process, but drummer Richard Ploog began to retreat further into his own habit, as pressure increased. The number of attempted studio takes spiralled and Ploog's relationship with Kilbey deteriorated, accentuated by Wachtel's demands for a consistently reliable tempo. Eventually Ploog's isolation led to exclusion and his drum tracks were replaced by rigid, but meter-perfect, programmed drums on all but three tracks. He left the band after the sessions.          The resulting album, ""Gold Afternoon Fix"", while different from its predecessor, reached No.12 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Albums Chart. While ""Starfish"" focused on a raw, live sound, ""Gold Afternoon Fix"" employed more ambient aspects, including piano, acoustic guitars and keyboards. On some tracks, the music was punctuated by clanging metal, rustling wind or sharp, industrial sounds.          ""Gold Afternoon Fix"" was heavily backed by a promotional campaign from Arista and the band went on tour, hiring Patti Smith's drummer, Jay Dee Daugherty. The album spawned a hit single, ""Metropolis"" (No. 19 in Australia, No. 11 on U.S. Mainstream Rock), but the follow-up, ""You're Still Beautiful"", did not chart. Ultimately, the album's sales were lower than ""Starfish""'s and press was mixed. The band, particularly Kilbey, would later dismiss the album as ""lousy"", ""hashed together"" and ""hideous"", although many of the songs have since become fixtures in the band's setlists.          After the dust had settled on ""Gold Afternoon Fix"", The Church returned to their old haunt at Sydney's Studios 301 to commence work on their next album. With lowered commercial expectations and less pressure from Arista, the atmosphere was more relaxed. Bringing in British producer Gavin MacKillop (Barenaked Ladies, Toad the Wet Sprocket, Straitjacket Fits) to supervise the sessions, the band began to improvise the framework for the next set of songs. The use of opium and, for Kilbey, heroin, saw the material take on a more expansive and surreal quality while Daugherty's jazzier approach on drums was a fresh change.          ""Priest=Aura"", titled from Kilbey's misreading of a Spanish fan's English vocabulary notes ('priest' = 'cura'), contains fourteen songs, many over six minutes long, and was their longest album yet at 65 minutes. With song concepts derived from cryptic, one-word working titles (an idea originally proposed by Willson-Piper), the lyrics leaned towards the abstract and esoteric. Emphasising free association and undirected coincidence between music and motif, Kilbey declined to define their meanings. Sonically, the music had numerous layers, courtesy of numerous guitar overdubs and MacKillop's rich production. The interplay between Koppes and Willson-Piper dominated throughout, especially on tracks such as ""Ripple,"" ""Kings,"" and the epic, aptly titled ""Chaos"", whose lyrics were a reflection of Steve Kilbey's unsettled lifestyle at the time.          Upon its release on 10 March 1992, ""Priest=Aura"" was given a mixed reception. It peaked in the ARIA Top 30, but reviews were varied, with some critical and others uncertain how to react. The band only went on a limited tour, confined to Australia, as Kilbey prepared for the birth of his twin daughters with Karin Jansson.          Adding to the decline in The Church's outlook was the announcement of Koppes' departure. His decision reflected two main factors: that the band had earned nothing for the two-week tour of Australia, and that he felt shut out of the creative process - a long-standing complaint that stretched back at least as far as Seance, if not further. Despite a completely sold-out tour, increasing personality conflicts within the band, especially with Willson-Piper, and frustration over their lack of success had made the situation intolerable. Despite its muted reception at the time of release, ""Priest=Aura"" is considered by both the band and fan base to be an artistic high point. In his 2014 autobiography, ""Something Quite Peculiar"", Kilbey calls it their ""undisputed masterpiece"".          Despite the loss of Koppes, Arista decided to stand by their contract and back another Church album and so Kilbey and Willson-Piper began to write new material. When it became clear that Daugherty would not be returning to the fold either, the remaining two took the opportunity to approach their music from new perspectives, abandoning their long-established roles and stylistic elements in favour of experimentation, spontaneity and electronica.          Early in 1994, the two brought in Willson-Piper's childhood friend Andy 'Dare' Mason to produce, record and mix. The album was mostly recorded at Sydney's Karmic Hit Studios and mixed at Karmic Hit and Studios 301. New Zealand drummer Tim Powles (ex-The Venetians) was hired for the sessions, having already played with Kilbey on his Jack Frost project. Considered temporary at the time, Powles would soon become a permanent member of the band and is still with them over 20 years later.          The resulting album, ""Sometime Anywhere"", released in May 1994, was generally well received and peaked in the Top 30. It is described as a ""rich, dark, epic release [which] picked up where ""Priest"" left off with lush, lengthy tracks"". Sales, however, were paltry and the first single, ""Two Places at Once"", did not chart. Promotion was minimal as Arista saw insufficient commercial promise in the release. With another commercially unsuccessful album on their hands, Arista did not renew The Church's contract and pulled financial support for a tour. Ambitious plans to stage full electric shows were scaled back, leaving Kilbey and Willson-Piper with only a short run of acoustic gigs as a duo.          Without a recording deal, the band's future looked bleak as Kilbey and Willson-Piper began work on new recordings in 1995. Although initially a two-man project, the new material saw input from new drummer Powles and hired violinist Linda Neil. Renewed contact between Kilbey and Peter Koppes led to the latter agreeing to guest on four songs - a welcome surprise for fans. Simon Polinski (Yothu Yindi) was drafted in to co-produce, engineer and mix the sessions. The music saw a return to guitar-based material, infused with krautrock and art rock influences. A 15-minute atmospheric piece called ""Magician Among the Spirits"" dominated the sessions, named after a book by Harry Houdini. Additional contributions by Utungun Percussion added a new, primal aspect to several songs.          The album, also called ""Magician Among the Spirits"", received mixed reviews, despite the guitar rock hook of its single, ""Comedown"". It was released on the band's own ""Deep Karma"" label, but due to financial constraints they had to arrange for outside distribution for the North American and European markets. This almost doomed the album from the beginning, but worse events were to come. Within a short time, the U.S. distributor went bankrupt, leaving the band stripped of its earnings from North American sales. Although exact figures remain unknown due to disputes, up to A$250,000 worth of merchandise (some 25,000 discs) was lost. For a band already on shaky ground, this was nearly the death knell. Comments by Kilbey in May of that year summed up the situation: ""There's no immediate future for The Church...Our management, the whole thing is broken down...We don't really have a label. We're owed lots and lots of money and we're broke. We're trying to pursue lawyers to get our money back. Marty and I aren't having any communication. There's no one really managing us so...that could have been the last record.""          Following the commercial failure of ""Magician Among the Spirits"", the members of The Church turned their attention to other projects and Willson-Piper left Australia again in order to collaborate with other artists and write new solo material. In his absence, Kilbey, Powles and Koppes spent some studio time together and quickly wrote and recorded an album as The Refo:mation. Loose in feel, but rich in atmosphere, the eccentrically-titled ""Pharmakoi/Distance-Crunching Honchos With Echo Units"" saw a greater focus on concise, guitar-dominated songs, in contrast to the experimentation of ""Magician Among the Spirits"".          Group tensions within The Church proper were still simmering, however. More than anyone else, it was new drummer Tim Powles who tried to alleviate the outstanding disagreements. While Koppes and Willson-Piper had already had differences for some time, Kilbey and Willson-Piper's relationship was also strained by recent problems. Kilbey declared that the end was nigh: after a final, worthy swan song, with the working title ""Au Revoir Por Favor"", the Church would be put to rest. The four agreed to play a string of farewell concerts around Australia, which turned out to be extremely successful. The roaring success of the intended ""final concert"" in Sydney put a quick end to talk of the band's demise.          The results of the new recording sessions saw a return to the band's roots: the material was once again based around Koppes and Willson-Piper's guitar interplay. Also, for the first time, the band completely produced itself, under Powles' aegis. Originally given the name ""Bastard Universe"", the forthcoming album was re-titled ""Hologram of Allah"" after Willson-Piper found the original too negative. Concerns about fundamentalist Muslim reaction to the potentially blasphemous title made the band finally opt for the more neutral ""Hologram of Baal"", after the Canaanite god. Released under a new contract with UK independent label Cooking Vinyl, the album was distributed in the U.S. by Thirsty Ear. A limited edition featured a bonus disc with a nearly 80-minute continuous improvised instrumental, which received the original title of the album, ""Bastard Universe"".          The reformed and rejuvenated band went on their first fully electric tour of the U.S., Australia and Europe in many years. A plan to release a live album called ""Bag of Bones"" was put into motion, but then cancelled.          Instead, a collection of cover songs was recorded, shedding light on the band's influences. Arriving in August 1999 - less than a year after ""Hologram of Baal"" - ""A Box of Birds"" contained an unusual selection of songs from Ultravox and Iggy Pop to The Monkees and Neil Young. The insert for the CD was designed as interchangeable, with 10 separate sleeve designs created by fans. As with ""Hologram of Baal"", a tour followed the album's release, but a new drama hit the band mid-tour in New York City when Kilbey was arrested for trying to purchase heroin. The band was forced to improvise a set after he failed to show, with Willson-Piper covering vocals. A night in jail and a day's community service on the Manhattan subway were Kilbey's only punishment. ""A drug bust is something every aging rock star should have under his belt"", he was later quoted as saying.          In 2001, ""Under the Milky Way"" was featured in the cult classic film Donnie Darko, helping to raise the band's profile once again. However, recording for their next album turned out to be painstakingly slow, due to numerous side projects and simple geography. With Kilbey now living in Sweden, Willson-Piper in England and the others in Australia, the bandmates met across several separate sessions. Partially recorded in both Sweden and Australia, the resulting ""After Everything Now This"", released in January 2002, saw a focus on the softer elements of the band. With only three obvious ""rock"" tracks out of ten, gentler moods dominated. The album achieved the biggest international success for The Church in almost ten years. The successive world tour featured the band in a more subtle setting as well, with most tracks performed primarily acoustically alongside guest David Lane on piano.          Fans would not have to wait long for another group release. The double-disc remix/outtakes set ""Parallel Universe"" hit stores in late 2002. Unique among the band's catalogue, the first disc, subtitled ""remixture"", featured a reshuffled, remixed, electronic version of the ""After Everything Now This"" album, the result of Tim Powles' collaboration with Sydney EDM musicians. The second disc, subtitled ""mixture"", compiled leftover songs from the ""After Everything Now This"" recording sessions.          Around the time that ""Parallel Universe"" was released, the Church had returned to the studio to record yet another album, eventually titled ""Forget Yourself"". Rather than fleshing the songs out over a long, gradual process, the band decided to keep the music as close to the original jam-based material as possible. Stylistically, this made for a much rawer sound, primarily recorded live and with minimal overdubs. As had become routine since ""Sometime Anywhere"", songs saw numerous instrument changes between members, with Powles playing guitar on ""Sealine"" and Willson-Piper switching to drums on ""Maya"". ""Forget Yourself"" was engineered and Co-Produced by Nic Hard and was released in Australia in October 2003 and in the U.S. in February 2004. The band toured extensively to support the album in Australia, the U.S. and Europe.          Their prolific output continued into 2004 with the release of three ancillary albums. Under the guidance of manager Kevin Lane Keller - an American fan and marketing professor who had been working with them since 2001 - the Church began capitalizing on the advantages offered by the internet and the independent music industry. First, in August, came the entirely improvised album ""Jammed"", containing just two long tracks and available exclusively from the band's website. Next, in October, came their third outtakes album, ""Beside Yourself"", covering the ""Forget Yourself"" sessions. Finally, only six weeks later, came ""El Momento Descuidado"", in which the band presented old and new material in an acoustic setting, for the Liberation Blue label. The title was a rough tongue-in-cheek translation of ""The Unguarded Moment"", a version of which was included. A short acoustic tour followed in late 2004 which initiated a new practice amongst the band members: that of swapping instruments on stage. The album was eventually nominated in 2005 for ""Best Adult Contemporary Album"" at the Australian ARIA Music Awards, although it did not win.          In 2005 The Church returned to full electric mode and began work on new material once again. The first release from these sessions was the outtakes album ""Back With Two Beasts"", released via their website as a teaser for the main album which would follow a few months later. ""Uninvited, Like the Clouds"", their 20th studio album, was released to rapturous reviews in April 2006 and was followed once again by extensive touring in Europe, the U.S. and Australia. Just prior to its release, in March, they performed ""Under the Milky Way"" with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra as part of the 2006 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony.          In February 2007 came ""El Momento Siguiente"", a second album of acoustic re-interpretations of earlier songs plus several new compositions and a cover version of The Triffids classic ""Wide Open Road"". Later that year the band toured Australia with The Pretenders and EMI released the double CD 'best of' collection ""Deep in the Shallows - The Classic Singles Collection"".          In 2006 The Church had embarked on their third improvised music project: to provide the soundtrack for a short film based on the renowned American science fiction writer Jeff Vandermeer's novel """". The music was released in 2008 as the album ""Shriek: Excerpts From The Soundtrack"", and was the first release on their new label, Unorthodox Records, a partnership with MGM Distribution.          In February 2009 the band began the build-up to their next major studio album with the ""Coffee Hounds"" EP, which featured the original, non-album composition ""The Coffee Song"" and a cover of Kate Bush's classic ""Hounds Of Love"". The following month they released the ""Pangaea"" EP, whose title track would also be on the upcoming album.          Unorthodox Records released the album ""Untitled #23"" in Australia in March and the U.S. label Second Motion Records released it to the rest of the world shortly thereafter. A double vinyl version quickly sold out. It was band's 23rd album-length Australian release of original studio material, while Kilbey also alluded to the mystical significance of the number 23 in an interview with music publication ""Music Feeds"". Another major international tour followed, the ""So Love May Find Us"" tour, named after a non-album track from the ""Pangaea"" EP.          Coinciding with the tour, a book entitled ""No Certainty Attached: Steve Kilbey and The Church"" by Robert Dean Lurie was published in Australia, the US, and the UK by Verse Chorus Press. While primarily a biography of Kilbey, the book also traced the evolution of the band from his perspective. This was not an official band project but Kilbey, Koppes, and various friends and family members did participate.          On 27 November 2009, the Church released another EP, ""Operetta"". The title track was taken from ""Untitled #23"" but the remaining tracks, including the 34-minute improvisation ""Particles Matter"", were unique to this release.          In February 2010 the band announced that they would be celebrating their 30th anniversary with an acoustic tour entitled ""An Intimate Space"". In a unique programme, the band chose one song from each of their many albums and performed them in reverse chronological order. The shows included a 28-page program and the ""Deadman's Hand"" EP, which included more unreleased material from the ""Untitled #23"" sessions. The U.S. leg of the tour spanned April and May, including a performance of ""Under the Milky Way"" on KUSI News in San Diego.          In October, Second Motion Records re-released six early Church albums in the U.S., with bonus tracks and extensive liner notes by Willson-Piper, along with the ""Deep In The Shallows"" singles collection.          On 27 October 2010 The Church were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame by media commentator George Negus, while young pop singer Washington performed ""The Unguarded Moment"". After their acceptance speech, the band performed ""Under the Milky Way"" and ""Tantalized"". In November and December they continued with the Australian leg of their ""An Intimate Space"" tour.          The band traveled to the U.S. once again in February 2011 in full electric mode for the ""Future Past Perfect"" tour, performing three albums in their entirety: ""Untitled #23"", ""Priest=Aura"" & ""Starfish"". Sold-out dates were played in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, Alexandria, Philadelphia, New York, Foxborough and Atlanta. This tour was the first on which the band was augmented onstage by the Australian multi-instrumentalist Craig Wilson, from the band astreetlightsong.          On 10 April The Church further celebrated their 30th anniversary with a special show entitled ""A Psychedelic Symphony"", at Sydney Opera House, which had been a year in preparation. Accompanied by conductor George Ellis and the Sydney University Symphony Orchestra, the concert was performed to a sold-out 2000+ capacity crowd and was recorded and filmed. A DVD and double CD were released by Unorthodox in June 2014, the band's first official live album. The show was also broadcast on the Australian music TV channel MAX during October 2011.          In December they concluded the ""Future Past Perfect"" tour with a dozen Australian dates. Their 17 December show at the Enmore Theatre, Sydney, was filmed and is available to stream here.          In November and December 2012, The Church played a major series of concerts across Australia and New Zealand, together with Simple Minds, Devo and Models. As part of the tour, they also played several ""A Day on the Green"" events with Models. During this tour they also played two intimate ""Art Rock 'n' Roll"" shows, one at the Corner Hotel in Melbourne and the other at the Factory Theatre in Sydney, where each member chose four songs from the band's catalogue, interspersed with a selection of concert staples.          In March 2013 there were the first signs of internal problems in the band, when Steve Kilbey issued a series of statements which indicated that he was considering leaving The Church due to a dispute over royalty payments. Then, later in the year, Kilbey announced on the band's Facebook page that Marty Willson-Piper would not be returning and had been replaced by former Powderfinger guitarist Ian Haug. Kilbey explained that Willson-Piper was ""not available"" for the recording of a new album and subsequent touring, and praised Haug as ""a brilliant guitarist"". Kilbey also provided a pre-emptive response to disgruntled fans: ""... if you can't dig it I'm sorry. this is my fucking band after all and it has existed at times without Peter and in the beginning without Marty. and for times in between while he went AWOL."" He also promoted sixteen ""very very fucking cool"" new songs that are ready to be recorded for the next Church album.          In early October 2014, Kilbey explained that Willson-Piper was not asked to leave the band, but that he had simply not replied to the various attempts made to contact him (Willson-Piper had relocated to Sweden). Realizing that Willson-Piper would not respond, Kilbey said to Powles at the time, ""We have to find someone with stature. He has to have his own trip, he can’t be some weedy little guy coming in to play guitar. It has to be somebody with experience and gravitas."" As part of the same interview, Haug explained that he had received a phone call from Kilbey while he was returning home from a funeral. Without first greeting Haug, Kilbey simply asked, ""If I asked you to join The Church, what would you say?"" and ended the call after Haug's affirmative, but bewildered, response. Haug said that joining the Church was the ""last thing"" that would have entered his mind, but that ""it just really seemed to work"".          Entitled ""Further/Deeper"", the Church's 24th studio album was released on 17 October 2014. Recorded over a period of eight days in late 2013, ""Further/Deeper"" was produced and engineered by Powles. Writing for the ""Courier-Mail"", Noel Mengel rated the album with 4.5 stars, while Jeff Apter assigned the album 4 stars in ""Rolling Stone Australia"". The band performed the album in its entirety during the ""Further/Deeper"" tours of Australia, North America and Europe.          In July, August and September 2015 they toured Australia and the U.S. again, supporting The Psychedelic Furs on some of the U.S. dates. On this tour (when not supporting) the band played most of ""Further/Deeper"" plus ""The Blurred Crusade"" in its entirety.

15357916,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15357916,The Phenomenon of Man,"The Phenomenon of Man (""Le phénomène humain"", 1955) is a book written by the French philosopher, paleontologist and Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. In this work, Teilhard describes evolution as a process that leads to increasing complexity, culminating in the unification of consciousness.          The book was finished in the 1930s, but was published posthumously in 1955. The Roman Catholic Church initially prohibited the publication of some of Teilhard’s writings on the grounds that they contradicted orthodoxy.          The foreword to the book was written by one of the key scientific advocates for natural selection and evolution of the 20th century, and a co-developer of the modern synthesis in biology, Julian Huxley.          Teilhard views evolution as a process that leads to increasing complexity. From the cell to the thinking animal, a process of psychical concentration leads to greater consciousness. The emergence of ""Homo sapiens"" marks the beginning of a new age, as the power acquired by consciousness to turn in upon itself raises humankind to a new sphere. Borrowing Huxley’s expression, Teilhard describes humankind as evolution becoming conscious of itself.          In Teilhard's conception of the evolution of the species, a collective identity begins to develop as trade and the transmission of ideas increases. Knowledge accumulates and is transmitted in increasing levels of depth and complexity. This leads to a further augmentation of consciousness and the emergence of a thinking layer that envelops the earth. Teilhard calls the new membrane the “noosphere” (from the Greek “""nous""”, meaning mind), a term first coined by Vladimir Vernadsky. The noosphere is the collective consciousness of humanity, the networks of thought and emotion in which all are immersed.           The development of science and technology causes an expansion of the human sphere of influence, allowing a person to be simultaneously present in every corner of the world. Teilhard argues that humanity has thus become cosmopolitan, stretching a single organized membrane over the Earth. Teilhard describes the process by which this happens as a ""gigantic psychobiological operation, a sort of mega-synthesis, the “super-arrangement” to which all the thinking elements of the earth find themselves today individually and collectively subject"". The rapid expansion of the noosphere requires a new domain of psychical expansion, which ""is staring us in the face if we would only raise our heads to look at it"".          In Teilhard’s view, evolution will culminate in the Omega Point, a sort of supreme consciousness. Layers of consciousness will converge in Omega, fusing and consuming them in itself. The concentration of a conscious universe will reassemble in itself all consciousnesses as well as all that we are conscious of. Teilhard emphasizes that each individual facet of consciousness will remain conscious of itself at the end of the process.          In 1961, the Nobel Prize-winner Peter Medawar, a British immunologist, wrote a scornful review of the book for the journal ""Mind"", calling it ""a bag of tricks"" and saying that the author had shown ""an active willingness to be deceived"": ""the greater part of it, I shall show, is nonsense, tricked out with a variety of metaphysical conceits, and its author can be excused of dishonesty only on the grounds that before deceiving others he has taken great pains to deceive himself"".          The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins called Medawar's review ""devastating"" , and ""The Phenomenon of Man"" ""the quintessence of bad poetic science"".          In the June 1995 issue of ""Wired"", Jennifer Cobb Kreisberg said, ""Teilhard saw the Net coming more than half a century before it arrived"":          Teilhard imagined a stage of evolution characterized by a complex membrane of information enveloping the globe and fueled by human consciousness. It sounds a little off-the-wall, until you think about the Net, that vast electronic web encircling the Earth, running point to point through a nerve-like constellation of wires.          In July 2009, during a vespers service in Aosta Cathedral in northern Italy, Pope Benedict XVI, reflecting on the Epistle to the Romans in which ""St. Paul writes that the world itself will one day become a form of living worship"", commented on Teilhard:          It's the great vision that later Teilhard de Chardin also had: At the end we will have a true cosmic liturgy, where the cosmos becomes a living host. Let's pray to the Lord that he help us be priests in this sense, to help in the transformation of the world in adoration of God, beginning with ourselves.","['Biological evolution', 'French books', 'Philosophy books', 'Jesuit publications', '1955 books', 'Harper & Brothers books']"
3415010,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3415010,Navarch,"Navarch (; pronounced ""návarchos"") is a Greek word meaning ""leader of the ships"", which in some states became the title of an office equivalent to that of a modern admiral.          Not all states gave their naval commanders such a title. Athens, for instance, placed its fleet under the command of generals (""strategoi"") holding the same title as those who commanded its land forces. Such command structures reflected the fact that, especially early in the Classical period, fleets operated in close conjunction with land forces, and indeed, the title of navarch did not begin to appear until the time of the Peloponnesian War, when fleets began to operate more independently. This separate title was originally used in cities that lacked an established naval tradition, Sparta being the most prominent, but entered broader use later, being adopted by the navies of the Hellenistic era states such as Macedon, Syracuse, Ptolemaic and Seleucid Empire, Achaean League, and Rhodes.          At Sparta and many other city-states, the position was held for one year only (a situation that compelled the Spartans to resort to an elaborate legal fiction when they wished to reinstate Lysander for more than one year in command). Admirals of despotic or monarchic states, however, could serve for years at a time. At Sparta, the position, unlike most high-level offices, was available to men from outside the Spartiate class; Lysander, the most famous occupant of the office, was a beneficiary of this rule.          ""Nauarchus"", a direct transliteration of the Greek term into Latin, was also used by the Roman Navy for its squadron commanders. The Greek-speaking Byzantines sometimes used the term to designate the captains of ships; the terms ""drungarios"" or ""strategos"" were used to designate their admirals.          In the modern Hellenic Navy, ""návarchos"" is the highest rank, equivalent to full admiral. All but one of the remaining flag ranks are also derivations of this word: ""Antinávarchos"" (αντιναύαρχος, ""deputy-admiral"") is the equivalent to vice admiral and ""yponávarchos"" (υποναύαρχος, ""under-admiral""), equivalent to rear admiral, while ""archiploíarchos"" is the equivalent of commodore. The same ranks are also used by the Hellenic Coast Guard. The rank of full ""návarchos"" is held in active service only by the Chief of the General Staff of National Defence, when he is a naval officer, and given to the Chiefs of the Hellenic Navy General Staff on retirement. Under the Greek monarchy, the five-star rank of ""archinávarchos"" (αρχιναύαρχος), equivalent to grand admiral or admiral of the fleet, existed, and was held only by the reigning monarch (Kings George II, Paul and Constantine II).","['Naval ranks', 'Ancient Greek titles', 'Hellenic Navy', 'Military ranks of ancient Greece', 'Military ranks of Greece', 'Military ranks of Sparta', 'Military ranks of ancient Macedon']"
15643493,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15643493,Bagne of Toulon,"The Bagne of Toulon was the notorious prison in Toulon, France, made famous as the place of imprisonment of Jean Valjean, the hero of ""Les Misérables"", the novel by Victor Hugo. The Bagne was opened in 1748 and closed in 1873.          The bagne was created by an ordinance of King Louis XV in 1748 to house the convicts who had previously been sentenced to row the galleys of the French Mediterranean fleet. The name 'bagne' came from the Italian word ""bagno"", or bath, the name of a prison in Rome which had formerly been a Roman bath.          Since the 15th century, French prisoners had been sentenced to serve on the galleys, sometimes even for minor crimes. By the eighteenth century, cannons and changes in modern naval warfare had made the galleys obsolete, and the use of galleys for punishment was stopped. The prisoners were first transferred to a group of ships tied up at the arsenal and port of Toulon, which were called the ""bagne flottant"" (the floating prison.) Then, new buildings were constructed on the shore in the Arsenal, between the Nouvelle Darse (new port) and Vieille Darse (old port.) Other bagnes were created in Brest and Rochefort.          Though there were no more galleys being built, prisoners continued to be sent to Toulon. The convicts were used for digging earth and construction work, both in the Arsenal and in the town. They also provided labor for the big treadmills used in spinning ropes in the Corderie, or rope factory, of the Arsenal.          The costumes of the prisoners consisted of a white shirt, yellow trousers, red vest and smock and a cap which had different colors depending on the sentence duration. Those sentenced to life imprisonment wore green caps, all the others red caps. Because of the similarity to the Phrygian cap, these were abolished for a short time during the French revolution. Before the French Revolution and again after 1810, the prisoners were also branded on the shoulder with a hot iron, using the letters ""TF"" (""travaux forcés"", hard labour) and ""TFP"" (""travaux forcés à perpétuité"", hard labour for life). One of their feet, typically the right one, was encircled with a ring of iron attached to a short chain, so that they could be immobilized. The most hardened criminals were chained two on two. An iron ball attached to the leg was used as a punishment for some times in the late 18th century, as was flogging with a tarred or knotted rope. These punishments were made less severe as the years passed.          The diet of the prisoners consisted of a small amount of meat and a ration of wine for the workers, and a large amount of dried vegetables, particularly beans. The prisoners used the word 'gourgane' (the word for 'beans' in the provençal language) to refer to the guards.          Since the sanitary conditions of the prison were extremely poor, a hospital was built within the prison in 1777 in the casemates of the southeast rampart of the Darse Vauban, and later additional buildings were added adjoining the rampart. In 1897 the hospital was moved to a much larger building, 200 meters long, which was built on the west quay of the ""Vieille Darse"" or old port, called the ""Grand Rang"". This building had a very large ground floor with a vaulted ceiling with three bays. The hospital occupied the upper floor. Two square towers with pyramid-shaped roofs were built at the north and south ends of the building. The rest of the building was occupied by administrative offices.          The healthy prisoners were originally housed along the west quay, where the hospital was eventually built. In 1814, they were moved to another building 115 meters long, oriented east-west, perpendicular to the hospital, which had been built in 1783 on the southwest quay of the Old Port, between the chain which blocked the entrance to the port and the ""Grand Rang"". Next to this building a ship was moored, called the ""Amiral"", which guarded the entrance to the port and fired a cannon shot each morning and each evening.          In 1836 the Bagne held 4,305 prisoners, of which 1,193 were sentenced to life imprisonment; 173 to more than twenty years imprisonment; 382 to terms between sixteen and twenty years; 387 to terms between eleven and fifteen years; 1469 to terms of between five and ten years; and 700 to terms of less than five years.          A few of the ""bagnards"", or prisoners, were well-known, notably a famous imposter named Coignard, who pretended to be the Count of St. Helena, and Eugène François Vidocq (23 July 1775 – 11 May 1857) a French criminal who later became the first director of Sûreté Nationale and one of the first modern private investigators, and who may have been the model for both Javert and Jean Valjean in Les Miserables.          At the beginning of the Second Empire of Napoleon III (Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte), the government decided to close the prisons at the naval ports, which were considered undesirable and expensive to run. It was therefore decided to replace the so-called ""bagnes métropolitains"", the prisons within cities, with transportation to French Guyana (with the central administration in Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni and Devil's Island mainly used for political prisoners) and later also to Nouméa in French New Caledonia. The bagnes of Rochefort and Brest were closed in 1852 and 1858 respectively, but Toulon, the largest, took longer to empty.           By 1873, the bagne had become too expensive to operate, and the workers were too unskilled and required too many guards to be of practical use. The bagne was closed, and the buildings were used for various military purposes. They survived until 1944, when the bagne was almost entirely destroyed by an Allied bombing raid. All that remains today is a single small building and a fragment of wall, on the southeast side of the Darse Vauban.          Besides Jean Valjean, several other characters in French literature spent time in the Bagne of Toulon:          Taken from the French-language Wikipedia article bagne de Toulon, and from the descriptive texts of the permanent exhibit on the bagne in Fort Balaguier.

Directed by Terence Young, later involved with some of the early James Bond films. Christopher Lee appears in a small role in the film.          The plot revolves around Johnny Solo (Leo Genn), the owner of the ""Pink Flamingo"" club in London's Soho area, and his battles with rival club owner Diamonds Dielli (Sheldon Lawrence) and the police. When the tough entrepreneur starts getting threats and demands for protection, he fights back.          Johnny's girlfriend Midnight Franklin (Jayne Mansfield), one of the club's headliners, wants to get him out of the business. In the background are a sadistic client, an underage chorus girl, a wisecracking siren who's not averse to rough trade, a visiting journalist, and a dancer who guards her past.          The reporter gets involved in the strip scene while writing a story on the clubs, and in the end he has quite a lot to write about. The competition between the two clubs heats up. Johnny becomes an unknowing instrument in the death of the chorus girl. Midnight informs on him to save his life from the violent blackmailers after him. Both rival clubs head for a crash.          ""Too Hot to Handle"" was Jayne Mansfield's first film away from 20th Century Fox after achieving stardom in the mid-1950s. By 1960, however, Mansfield's box office popularity had faded, and Fox loaned her (as they did others) to foreign studios while they awaited a good film for her. This British drama is usually marked as the beginning of her descent into low-budget productions.          The film was billed as ""an exposé of 'sexy, sordid Soho, England's greatest shame'"".          Notorious in its day because Mansfield's risqué see-through clothing and racy musical numbers caused some controversy, holding up the American release until January 1961, while the sexiest frames were fully displayed in ""Playboy"" magazine. For its American releases, ""Too Hot to Handle"" was retitled ""Playgirl After Dark"" and was mildly edited to meet America's censor requirements. ""Halliwell's Film and Video Guide"" describes the film as a ""rotten, hilarious British gangster film set in a totally unreal underworld and very uncomfortably cast.""          While filmed and released in Eastman Color, the VHS and DVD editions are in black-and-white for unknown reasons.","['1960 films', 'British films', 'English-language films', '1960s drama films', 'Film noir', 'Films directed by Terence Young', 'British crime films', 'Films set in London', 'Gangster films', 'British drama films']"
7453753,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7453753,Seymour H. Knox I,"Seymour Horace Knox I (April 1861 – May 17, 1915), was a Buffalo, New York businessman who made his fortune in five-and-dime stores. He merged his more than 100 stores with those of his first cousins, Frank Winfield Woolworth and Charles Woolworth, to form the F. W. Woolworth Company. He went on to hold prominent positions in the merged company as well as Marine Trust Co. He was the father of Seymour H. Knox II and grandfather of Seymour H. Knox III and Northrup Knox, the co-founders of the Buffalo Sabres in the National Hockey League.          He was born in April 1861 in Russell, Saint Lawrence County, New York. His father was James Horace Knox, a farmer married to Jane E. McBrier. James' grandfather had fought in the American Revolution. William Knox, was the first of this line of Knoxes to come to Massachusetts from Belfast, Ireland, in 1737.          Seymour attended the Russell district school and at fifteen, though he had never gone to high school, began to teach in school himself.          At seventeen he moved to Hart, Michigan, where for a few years he worked as a salesclerk. Then he left for Reading, Pennsylvania, where he entered into a partnership with his first cousins. He later donated the Knox Memorial Central School Building (dedicated on July 30, 1913) that served the town until the Knox Memorial School and Edwards Central School merged. He initially became a partner with the Woolworths by jointly opening a Reading, Pennsylvania, Woolworth & Knox store with them on September 20, 1884, using his entire life savings. The Reading store's first several hours had no sales. However, after the partners took a lunchtime walk, they returned at 1:30 to find the local factory workers had been let out at 1:00—with their paychecks. Sales were brisk, and the partners never looked back. His second store, in Newark, New Jersey, was short lived, but his partnership thrived nonetheless. The third venture, in Erie, Pennsylvania, enabled them to buy out the Newark lease. He partnered with Frank to open the first Buffalo store, at 409 Main Street, on October 13, 1888.          By 1889, he was able to buy out his cousins. He maintained a collegial business relationship with his cousins after the buyout. In fact, he bought Woolworth merchandise at wholesale and sometimes traded in competition. He formed another brief partnership with another friendly rival, Earle Perry Charlton, from 1889–1895, opening his Buffalo ""S.H. Knox Co."" 5 and 10 Cent Store in 1890. In 1890, he made established headquarters in the Buffalo store. Sources disagree on the chronology of later stores. One source says that the second Buffalo store was opened at 549 William Street on June 20, 1891. Another says Knox opened his second store on December 18, 1893, at 519 Main Street four days after the first store at 409 Main Street was destroyed in the Wonderland Building Fire. The 519 Main Street store replaced the 409 Main Street after the December 14, 1893 fire and moved to 395 Main Street in 1895. He continued to build his S.H. Knox Co. 5 and 10 Cent Store empire. By the time of the 1911 incorporation of F. W. Woolworth Company, Knox was the second largest of six store operators with 98 U.S. and 13 Canadian locations. In 1912, he received $12 million of the $65 million merger proceeds and was appointed Director and Senior Vice-Principal of the Corporation. Knox is remembered as the pioneering city center store operator. His Detroit, Michigan store was the first outside of the agricultural and small-market towns. Many of the Woolworth friendly rivals emulated his plan.          In 1913, he purchased Stephen Clement's interests in Marine National. At his death, Seymour was Vice President of the Woolworth Co. and Chairman of the Board of the Marine Trust Co. He was the first of three generations of the family to serve as Chairman.          Seymour married Grace Millard Knox (1862–1936), in 1890, and they raised three children:          Among his grandchildren were Seymour H. Knox III and Northrup R. Knox, the original principal owners of the Buffalo Sabres. Grace established The University at Buffalo's first endowment fund in 1916 when she donated $250,000. Knox bred champion trotters and pacers and was a polo enthusiast.          Knox died on May 17, 1915 in Buffalo, New York.","['1861 births', '1915 deaths', 'American businesspeople', 'Knox family', 'People from Buffalo, New York', 'Woolworth family']"

16190896,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16190896,Daylight saving time in the United States,"Daylight saving time in the United States is the practice of setting the clock forward by one hour during the warmer part of the year, so that evenings have more daylight and mornings have less. Most areas of the United States observe daylight saving time (DST), the exceptions being Arizona (except for the Navajo Nation, which does observe daylight saving time), Hawaii, and the overseas territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.          Daylight saving time starts on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November, with the time changes taking place at 2:00 a.m. local time. With a mnemonic word play referring to seasons, clocks ""spring forward and fall back""—that is, in springtime the clocks are moved forward from 2:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., and in fall they are moved back from 2:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. Daylight saving time lasts for a total of 34 weeks (238 days) every year, about 65% of the entire year (even in leap years).          The following table lists recent past and near future starting and ending dates of daylight saving time in the United States:          During World War I, in an effort to conserve fuel, Germany began observing DST on May 1, 1916. The rest of Europe soon followed. The plan was not adopted in the United States until the Standard Time Act of March 19, 1918, which established standard time zones and set summer DST to begin on March 31, 1918 (reverting October 27). The idea was unpopular and Congress abolished DST after the war, overriding President Woodrow Wilson's veto. DST became a local option and was observed in some states until World War II, when President Franklin Roosevelt instituted year-round DST, called ""War Time"", on February 9, 1942. It lasted until the last Sunday in September 1945. After 1945 many states and cities east of the Mississippi River (and mostly north of the Ohio and Potomac Rivers) adopted summer DST.          From 1945 to 1966 there was no federal law on daylight saving time, so localities could choose when it began and ended or drop it entirely. In 1954 only California and Nevada had statewide DST west of the Mississippi, and only a few cities between Nevada and St Louis. In the 1964 Official Railway Guide, 21 of the 48 states had no DST anywhere.          By 1962 the transportation industry found the lack of consistency confusing enough to push for federal regulation. The result was the Uniform Time Act of 1966 (P.L. 89-387). Beginning in 1967, the act mandated standard time within the established time zones and provided for advanced time: clocks would be advanced one hour beginning at 2:00 a.m. on the last Sunday in April and turned back one hour at 2:00 a.m. on the last Sunday in October. States were allowed to exempt themselves from DST as long as the entire state did so. If a state chose to observe DST, the time changes were required to begin and end on the established dates. In 1967 Arizona and Michigan became the first states to exempt themselves from DST (Michigan would begin observing DST in 1972). In 1972 the act was amended (P.L. 92-267), allowing those states split between time zones to exempt either the entire state or that part of the state lying within a different time zone. The newly created Department of Transportation (DOT) was given power to enforce the law. As of 2014 the following states and territories are not observing DST: Arizona, Hawaii, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.          During the 1973 oil embargo by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC), in an effort to conserve fuel Congress enacted a trial period of year-round DST (P.L. 93-182), beginning January 6, 1974, and ending April 27, 1975. The trial was hotly debated. Those in favor pointed to increased daylight hours in the winter evening: more time for recreation, reduced lighting and heating demands, reduced crime, and reduced automobile accidents. The opposition was concerned about children leaving for school in the dark. The act was amended in October 1974 (P.L. 93-434) to return to standard time for the period beginning October 27, 1974, and ending February 23, 1975, when DST resumed. When the trial ended in 1975, the country returned to observing summer DST (with the aforementioned exceptions).          The DOT, evaluating the plan of extending DST into March, reported in 1975 that ""modest overall benefits might be realized by a shift from the historic six-month DST (May through October) in areas of energy conservation, overall traffic safety and reduced violent crime."" However, DOT also reported that these benefits were minimal and difficult to distinguish from seasonal variations and fluctuations in energy prices.          Congress then asked the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) to evaluate the DOT report. Its report, ""Review and Technical Evaluation of the DOT Daylight Saving Time Study"" (April 1976), found no significant energy savings or differences in traffic fatalities. It did find statistically significant evidence of increased fatalities among school-age children in the mornings during the four-month period January–April 1974 as compared with the same period (non-DST) of 1973. NBS stated that it was impossible to determine, what, if any, of this increase was due to DST. When these data were compared between 1973 and 1974 for the months of March and April, no significant difference was found in fatalities among school-age children in the mornings.          In 1986 Congress enacted P.L. 99-359, amending the Uniform Time Act by changing the beginning of DST to the first Sunday in April and having the end remain the last Sunday in October. These start and end dates were in effect from 1987 to 2006. The time was adjusted at 2:00 a.m. local time.          By the Energy Policy Act of 2005, daylight saving time (DST) was extended in the United States beginning in 2007. As of that year, DST begins on the second Sunday of March and ends on the first Sunday of November. These changes result in a DST period that is five weeks longer than previously in years where April 1 falls on Monday through Wednesday and four weeks longer than previously in years where April 1 falls on Thursday through Sunday. In 2008 daylight saving time ended at 2:00 a.m. DST (0200) (1:00 a.m. ST) on Sunday, November 2, and in 2009 it began at 2:00 a.m. (3:00 a.m. DST) on Sunday, March 8. Wyoming Senator Michael Enzi and Michigan Representative Fred Upton advocated the extension from October into November especially to allow children to go trick-or-treating in more daylight.          Under Section 110 of the Act, the U.S. Department of Energy was required to study the impact of the 2007 DST extension no later than nine months after the change took effect. The report, released in October 2008, reported a nationwide electricity savings of 0.03% for the year of 2007.          An October 2008 study conducted by the University of California at Santa Barbara for the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the 2006 DST adoption in Indiana increased energy consumption in Indiana by an average of 1%. Although energy consumption for lighting dropped as a result of the DST adoption, consumption for heating and cooling increased by 2 to 4%. The cost to the average Indiana household of the DST adoption was determined to be $3.29 per year, for an aggregate cost of $1.7 million to $5.5 million per year.          Under the Standard Time Act of 1918, as amended by the Uniform Time Act of 1966, moving a state or an area within a state from one time zone to another requires a regulation issued by DOT. The governor or state legislature may initiate a request for the state or any part of the state; the highest elected officials in the county may make a request for that county. The standard in the statute for such decisions is the convenience of commerce in that area. The convenience of commerce is defined broadly to consider such circumstances as the shipment of goods within the community; the origin of television and radio broadcasts; the areas where most residents work, attend school, worship, or receive health care; the location of airports, railway, and bus stations; and the major elements of the community's economy.          After receiving a request for altering a time zone, DOT determines whether it meets the requirement of minimum statutory criteria before issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking, soliciting public comment and scheduling a public hearing. Usually the hearing is held in the area requesting the change so that all affected parties can be represented. After the close of the comment period, the comments are reviewed and appropriate final action taken. If the Secretary agrees that the statutory requirement has been met, the change is instituted, usually at the next changeover to or from DST.          Under the Uniform Time Act, moving an area on or off DST is accomplished through legal action at the state level. Some states require legislation while others require executive action such as a governor's executive order. Information on procedures required in a specific state may be obtained from that state's legislature or governor's office. Although it may exempt itself, if a state decides to observe DST, the dates of observance must comply with federal legislation.          Alaska observes DST. Due to its high latitude, Alaska has nearly round-the-clock daylight during summer and DST is seen by some Alaskans as unnecessary and a nuisance. Another issue is that the Alaskan mainland's single time zone, which approximates solar time in the capital, Juneau, leads to a large disparity between civil time and solar time for much of the state, with solar noon occurring as late as 2:00 p.m. in the population centers of Anchorage and Fairbanks, and as late as 3:00 p.m. by the clock in places such as Nome. In Fairbanks, for example, sunset occurs well after civil midnight in the summer. Others argue that ending daylight saving time will place Alaska as much as five hours from Eastern Daylight Time, making coordination of travel and phone conversations more difficult.          In March 2015 the Alaska Senate passed a bill, introduced by state senator Anna MacKinnon, to end daylight saving time. The Alaska House formed a sub-committee that will look into the issue during the 2016 legislative session.          Arizona observed DST in 1967 under the Uniform Time Act because the state legislature did not enact an exemption statute that year. In March 1968 the DST exemption statute was enacted and the state of Arizona has not observed DST since 1967. This is in large part due to energy conservation: Phoenix and Tucson are among the hottest US metropolitan areas during the summer, resulting in more power usage from air conditioning units and evaporative coolers in homes and businesses. An extra hour of sunlight while people are active would cause people to run their cooling systems longer, thereby using more energy.          The Navajo Indian Reservation, which extends into two adjacent states, Utah and New Mexico, does observe daylight saving time. The Hopi Reservation, which is entirely within the state of Arizona and is an enclave of the Navajo Indian Reservation, does not observe DST.          California voters passed Proposition 12 in 1949, approving DST in the state. In February 2016, California State Assembly member Kansen Chu introduced a bill that would exempt DST in the state. Chu cites the arguments made by DST opponents, such as the little evidence that it saves energy, it increases health risks, and causes more car and workplace accidents. If the California Legislature passes this bill, it must still go before the state's voters in order to be enacted and thus repeal Proposition 12.          ""Colorado Springs Gazette"" columnist Ralph Routon wrote a series of columns in 1999 promoting placing all of Colorado on year-round DST in order to save state residents the ""aggravation of resetting their clocks every six months."" Routon mentions in his original column, several other effects, which would benefit some of the state's citizens, including him.          The idea gathered popular support in Colorado Springs and the attention of the state's larger newspapers with some attention being negative. When state Senator MaryAnne Tebedo attempted to present the idea to the state legislature, her research uncovered federal laws forbidding the state-initiated extension of daylight saving time. Still determined to relieve Coloradans of the need to change their clocks, Tebedo introduced the only bill legally permitted to her: a proposal to exempt the state of Colorado from DST. The bill did not advance from committee during the 2000 legislative session.          Daylight time is less useful in Florida than in many other states because its southern location leads to less variation in day length between winter and summer. Without DST, Miami, for instance, would experience similar sunrise and sunset times throughout the year to cities such as Honolulu or Hong Kong, both of which have abandoned DST for decades. There is opposition to DST in Florida. State senator Bill Posey introduced a bill in March 2008 to abolish daylight time in the state and keep Florida on year-round standard time. Because Florida straddles two time zones, the Florida legislature has the option of returning all or part of the state to standard time along time zone boundaries (i.e. placing the portion of the state in the Eastern time zone on standard time, while leaving the portion in the Central time zone on DST, so that the whole state had a common time).          Hawaii has never observed daylight saving time under the Uniform Time Act, having opted out of the Act's provisions in 1967.          Because of Hawaii's tropical latitude, there is not a large variation in daylight length between winter and summer. Advancing the clock in Hawaii would make sunrise times close to 7:00 a.m. even in June. Most of the inhabited islands are located close to the west end of the Hawaii-Aleutian time zone, but Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau are located more than 7 degrees west of the Hawaii-Aleutian time zone's meridian and should, theoretically, be located in the next time zone to the west. (Until about 1946 Hawaiian standard time was based on longitude 157.5 deg west rather than 150 deg.)          On April 26, 1933, the Territorial Legislature enacted a bill placing Hawaii on daylight saving time from the last Sunday in April (April 30 in that year) to the last Sunday in September, but the law was repealed three weeks later on May 21, 1933. During World War II between February 9, 1942 and September 30, 1945, Hawaiian Standard Time was advanced one hour to so-called ""Hawaiian War Time,"" effectively placing the territory on year-round daylight saving time.          From 1970 until 2006, most of Indiana in the Eastern Time Zone did not observe daylight saving time, but the entire state started to do so in April 2006 after eight counties in western Indiana were shifted from the Eastern Time Zone to the Central Time Zone. One goal for observing DST was to get more Indiana counties observing the same time zone; formerly, 77 counties observed EST, 5 observed EST/EDT (the EDT usage being unofficial only), and 10 observed CST/CDT. , Indiana has 12 counties observing Central Daylight Time while the remaining 80 counties observe Eastern Daylight Time. Those counties observing CST are in two groups: one near or in the Chicago metropolitan area, and the other around Evansville in the southwest corner of the state.          In 1967 the Michigan Legislature adopted a statute, Act 6 of the Public Acts of 1967, exempting the state from the observance of DST. The exemption statute was suspended on June 14, 1967, however, when the referendum was invoked. From June 14, 1967 until the last Sunday in October, 1967, Michigan observed DST, and did so in 1968 as well. The exemption statute was submitted to the voters at the General Election held in November 1968, and, in a close vote, the exemption statute was sustained. As a result, Michigan did not observe DST in 1969, 1970, 1971, or 1972. In November 1972, an initiative measure, repealing the exemption statute, was approved by the voters. Michigan again observed DST in 1973, and has continued to do so since then.          The vast majority of Michigan is in the Eastern Time Zone. Only the Upper Peninsula counties that border Wisconsin (Gogebic, Iron, Dickinson, and Menominee) are in Central Time.          In 2005, Nevada Assembly Bill 18 would have exempted Nevada from daylight saving time. The bill's author, Assemblyman Bob McCleary, D-North Las Vegas, argued that because of southern Nevada's desert climate, it would reduce power usage during the peak summer months by reducing the time that people would operate their home air conditioners. The result of not observing DST, however, would place the state in an odd time configuration relative to neighboring states. Because it is on the eastern edge of the Pacific Time Zone, Nevada (PST) would be two hours behind Utah (MDT), its eastern neighbor, and one hour behind California (PDT), its western neighbor. In the summer, it would therefore be the same time in Nevada (PST) as it would be in the majority of Alaska (AKDT). The bill died without a vote.          In 2015 the Nevada Senate passed Nevada Assembly Joint Resolution 4, which would make it so that Nevada remains on Daylight Saving Time throughout the year. This would mean that Nevada is on the same time as Arizona all year, but would be an hour ahead of California in the winter. The United States Congress must now approve the change.          Republican Rep. Curry Todd of Collierville has sponsored a bill to establish permanent Daylight Saving Time in Tennessee, to become effective July 2014. The bill passed out of subcommittee in mid February 2014, despite some concerns from other lawmakers. The bill was expected to go to vote by the House State Government Committee in late February. It failed to pass when voted on March 25, 2014. An amendment to the federal Uniform Time Act would be required in order for Tennessee or any other state to observe year-round daylight saving time. The federal statute mandates the period during which standard time must be observed and the period during which daylight saving time must be observed, and sets forth the circumstances under which a state may elect to observe standard time throughout the year. There is no option for a state to observe year-round daylight saving time short of DOT approval to move to another time zone.          Republican Rep. Dan Flynn authored a bill (H.B. 150) to exempt the state from observing DST. On May 8, 2015 the Texas House of Representatives voted down the proposal 56–79 due to arguments including the effects on start times for NFL games.          In 2015, State Rep. Elizabeth Scott told a House committee that the semiannual time switches are not only inconvenient but lead to health problems and accidents due to lost sleep. She added that the bill to drop daylight saving time would reduce heart attacks, car wrecks and work accidents found to increase with the sleep-schedule disruptions. Opposition to similar measures in other states has come from recreational business interests. The Golf Association for Utah told state officials that earlier night fall would cause a loss in revenues.          All U.S. insular territories with civilian government (American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands) lie in the tropics and do not observe DST.          While neighboring Samoa began observing DST in September 2010, the smaller American Samoa cannot legally follow because of the DST observation period mandated by the Uniform Time Act. This period is actually wintertime in this Southern Hemisphere territory.          Many computer operating systems (such as Microsoft Windows, Linux, UNIX, and OS X) and programming languages (such as Java, perl, and most shell languages) allow a local time zone setting in the format of ""(standard time zone abbreviation)(UTC hour difference)(daylight saving time zone abbreviation)"". This allows programs and programming languages that must do calculations based on local time to more easily calculate differences between local time and UTC, as well as knowing whether calculations should be changed during daylight saving time. For example, a time zone setting of EST5EDT indicates that local time on the computer is 5 hours behind UTC and should be adjusted for daylight saving time.

11342184,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11342184,Caryll Houselander,"Caryll Houselander (29 September 1901 – 12 October 1954) was a lay Roman Catholic ecclesiastical artist, mystic, popular religious writer and poet.          Born in Bath, England, Houselander was the second of two daughters of Wilmott and Gertrude Provis Houselander.          Several authors, including Maisie Ward in her 1962 biography ""Caryll Houselander: That Divine Eccentric"", incorrectly state that Houselander was born on 29 October 1901 when, in fact, she was born on 29 September 1901 according to her birth certificate (cited in Andrew Cook, ""Ace of Spies: The True Story of Sidney Reilly"", rev. ed., 2004, p. 319, n. 27) and her remark in ""A Rocking-Horse Catholic"" (cited below, p. 41) that she took the confirmation ""name of Michael after the Archangel on whose feast day I was born.""          When Houselander was six, her mother converted to Catholicism and she in turn was so baptised. Shortly after her ninth birthday, her parents separated and her mother opened a boarding house to support the family. Houselander was sent to a convent where she reported her first mystical experience. One day, she entered a room and saw a Bavarian nun sitting by herself, weeping and polishing shoes. At this time, there was much anti-German sentiment owing to the war. As she stared, she saw the nun's head being pressed down by a crown of thorns that she was to interpret as Christ's suffering in the woman.          In her teens, she returned home to help her mother in the running of the boarding house. Gertrude allowed a priest to stay and this became such a source of scandal that Houselander and her mother suffered ostracism in the community. This may have been partly influential in her decision to leave the Roman Catholic Church as a teenager, not returning until in her twenties. It may also have contributed to a sense of isolation she would feel at times, reflected in panic attacks when entering rooms and meeting strangers, so much so that she was considered neurotic.          One night, in July 1918, Houselander was sent by her mother on an errand. On her way to the street vendor, she looked up and saw what she later described as a huge Russian icon spread across the sky. The icon she saw was Christ crucified lifted up and looking down, brooding over the world. Shortly after, she read in a newspaper an article about the assassination of Russian Tsar Nicholas II. She said the face she saw in the newspaper photograph was the face she saw spread out over the sky as the crucified Christ.          A third vision occurred when she was travelling on a busy underground train when she suddenly saw Christ, living and rejoicing, suffering and dying, in each and everyone of the passengers. When she left the train, the mystical experience continued for several days, during which she became persuaded that the unity of life in Christ was the only solution to loneliness and the human condition.          Another experience involved one of her doctors, who had died but appeared and sat next to her on a bus. They were able to talk and converse.          The three mystical experiences she claimed to have experienced convinced her that Christ is to be found in all people, even those whom the world shunned because they did not conform to certain standards of piety. She would write that if people looked for Christ in only the ""saints,"" they would not find him. She herself smoked and drank and had a sharp tongue. She returned to the Catholic Church in 1925, but her spiritual reading was founded almost entirely on the Gospels, rather than the Fathers of the Church or official Church documents. She met and fell in love with Sidney Reilly, famous spy and the model for Ian Fleming's James Bond, but he left her broken-hearted when he married another woman. She would never marry.          Houselander was a prolific writer and contributed many pieces to religious magazines, such as the ""Messenger of the Sacred Heart"" and ""The Children's Messenger"". Her first book, ""This War is the Passion"", was published in 1941 and in it she placed the suffering of the individual and its meaning within the mystical body of Christ. For a time, she became publishers Sheed & Ward's best selling writer, drawing praise from people such as Ronald Knox:""she seemed to see everything for the first time, and the driest of doctrinal considerations shone out like a restored picture when she had finished with it. And her writing was always natural; she seemed to find no difficulty in getting the right word; no, not merely the right word, the telling word, that left you gasping.""          During the Second World War, doctors began sending patients to Houselander for counselling and therapy. Even though she lacked formal education in this area, she seemed to have a natural empathy for people in mental anguish and the talent for helping them to rebuild their world. A visitor once found her alone on the floor, apparently in great pain, which she attributed to her willingness to take on herself a great trial and temptation that was overwhelming another person.          A psychiatrist, Eric Strauss, later President of the British Psychological Society, said of Houslander: ""she loved them back to life... .she was a divine eccentric.""          Houselander titled her autobiography ""A Rocking-Horse Catholic"" to differentiate herself from those termed ""cradle Catholics"". She died of breast cancer in 1954, at the age of 53.          Love is most likely to spring from another's need for us, and the fact of spending ourselves for another always generates new life in us. To give life is the purpose of love, and we love those people most of all whose needs waken a response in us that floods us with creative energy, causing us to put out new green shoots of life.          Christ is among us          His heart like a rose          expanding within us . . .          God's will for you is to serve him, in his way, as he chooses now. It is only a want of humility to think of extreme vocations, like being a nun or a nurse, while you try to by-pass your present obvious vocation . . . Today you have to use what you have today, and do not look beyond it.          We go through life with dark forces within us and around us, haunted by the ghosts of repudiated terrors and embarrassments, assailed by devils, but we are also continually guided by invisible hands; our darkness is lit by many little flames, from night-lights to the stars. Those who are afraid to look into their own hearts know nothing of the light that shines in the darkness.          Prayer alone can teach us to concentrate again, can lead us to absolute trust in God, and make our minds ready for other essential things . . . for the contemplation (not mere observation) of beauty.          It seems a law of fallen nature that life must always come to its being through darkness, and this makes us even more aware of its beauty. Dawn is lovelier because it comes after night, spring because it follows winter.          To surrender all that we are, as we are, to the spirit of love in order that our lives may bear Christ into the world – that is what we shall be asked.          The beginning of human happiness, and even of human sanity, is to begin to know           God . . . Goodness draws the human soul as a tide is drawn by light.          Lift up your eyes and see the star!          The one essential for sanctity is the capacity to love.          The one thing she [Mary] did and does is the one thing that we all have to do, namely, to bear Christ into the world.

415114,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=415114,Coregonus lavaretus,"Coregonus lavaretus is a species of freshwater whitefish, in the family Salmonidae. It is the type species of its genus ""Coregonus"".          There are widely different concepts about the delimitation of the species ""Coregonus lavaretus"" and about the number of species in the genus ""Coregonus"" in general.          In a narrow sense, ""Coregonus lavaretus"", or the lavaret, is considered to be endemic          to Lake Bourget and Lake Aiguebelette in the Rhône river basin in France, whereas it formerly also occurred in Lake Geneva. According to this view there is a great number of distinct whitefish species in lakes, rivers and brackish waters of Central and Northern Europe.          In the broad sense, ""Coregonus lavaretus"", referred to as the common whitefish or European whitefish, is widespread from central and northwest Europe to Siberia. Often called the ""C. lavaretus"" complex and considered as a superspecies, it encompasses many of the whitefish populations suggested by others to be locally restricted species (such as the British powan and the gwyniad or the Alpine gravenche, as well as distinct intralacustrine morphs and populations characterized by different feeding habits, gill raker numbers, growth patterns and migration behaviour. Genetic studies suggest that the whitefish diversity within this complex is mostly of post-glacial origin. The resource polymorphism represented by the feeding morphs has evolved repeatedly and independently within individual lakes, and similar morphs in different lakes are not related to each other.          There is much variation among the European whitefish forms, but in general they have a tapered body, a slightly protruding upper jaw and a fleshy dorsal fin that is typical of the salmon family. The snout is short and tapered, a fact that distinguishes this species from the two other North European ""Coregonus"" species, vendace (""Coregonus albula"") and the introduced peled (""Coregonus peled""). The former has a protuberant lower jaw while in the latter, the jaws are equal in length. The back is bluish green or brownish, the flanks silvery and the belly white. The fins are dark grey. This fish seldom grows more than long or exceeds in weight.          The European whitefish mostly feed on bottom-dwelling invertebrates or zooplankton. Larger fish also take insects off the surface of the water and eat fish fry. Breeding takes place in the autumn between September and November, largely depending on the water temperature. Different populations in the same sections of water may spawn at different times. Many populations in seas and lakes tend to make their way up-river to spawn, but others populations remain in lakes or the sea even when breeding.","['Coregonus', 'Freshwater fish of Europe', 'Animals described in 1758']"

3025019,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3025019,Terminal Railway Post Office,"Terminal railway post offices were sorting facilities which were established by the Railway Mail Service to speed the distribution of parcel post. These offices were usually located in or near railroad stations in major cities or junction points. Terminal railway post offices operated generally from 1913-1914 into the mid-1960s, before their function was absorbed by post office sectional centers.          On January 1, 1913, the United States Post Office began handling parcel post, in addition to letters and more conventional mail. This service, which was in direct competition with the privately owned express companies, was quickly embraced by the general public, and over two million packages were mailed in the first week after parcel post service began.          Terminal Railway Post Offices (Term RPO) were started in nearly 100 cities in late 1913 and 1914, primarily to help handle the increase in volume of parcel post which was overwhelming the main transportation system. These terminals also came to distribute transit parcel post, circulars, magazines, and papers - mail that was generally considered less urgent than first class letters. Letter cases were used at many terminals to take care of advance work or unworked letters from Railway Post Office (RPO) routes, while a few terminals handled parcel post almost exclusively. The largest terminal railway post office was the Penn Terminal in the G.P.O. Building in New York City, New York -- in 1951, it had over 1,100 clerks. Penn Terminal handled advance work for many of the railway post office routes leaving New York City. By comparison, the West Side Terminal, located along the New York Central line near the Hudson River piers, handled parcel post almost exclusively. Because parcel post transportation was generally by rail, most terminal RPOs were housed in or adjacent to the railroad station.          Where mails for more than one state were distributed, the ""state rights"" of the assignments were prorated. If one-fourth of the mail distributed at the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Terminal was Ohio mail, clerks with ""Ohio rights"" were entitled to one-fourth of the assignments.          The number of Terminal railway post offices peaked in 1914, with nearly 100 offices. In 1915, that number declined to 88, with a further decline to 71 offices by 1942, as many smaller offices were closed and their duties returned to RPO routes.           All the mail originating in the cities where Terminals were located was distributed by the city post offices. In many cases, this duplication of distribution was in the same building. Local postmasters had no jurisdiction over terminal RPO operations until the 1950s, when all the terminals were put under the supervision of the postmasters of the city in which they were located. The filling of assignments in the terminal was then limited to the roster from the civil service examination of the city post office.          As railway post office routes declined in number, the volume of parcel post transported by this mode also decreased, allowing the closure of smaller terminals. Development of the U.S. Postal Service sectional centers duplicated many of the functions of the terminal RPO, and the terminals were phased out by the 1960s.          First class mail worked (sorted for distribution) by terminal RPOs usually received a Terminal RPO postmark. Like the cancellations from RPO cars themselves, terminal RPO postmarks are collected by those who specialize in this aspect of postal history.          This is a preliminary list of some of the almost 100 terminal railway post office facilities which existed between 1913 and the early 1960s.","['Rail transportation in the United States', 'United States Postal Service']"

The lake is man-made, the result of sluicing operations that began in 1873 when John Ewing (1844–1922) formed the St.Bathans Channel Company, to mine the Kildare Hill Gold Claim in St Bathans. His company constructed a tailings channel and introduced hydraulic elevating to work the claim. As this work progressed the Kildare Hill Claim became the site of the deepest hydraulic elevating operation in the world, that would turn a 120-metre hill into a 68-metre hole. Work stopped in 1902 when there was insufficient fall in the tailings channel to carry away the tailings. By 1905 John Ewing was bankrupt as a result of poor investments in other locations. The Kildare Hill Claim was then taken up by the Scandinavian Water Race Company in that year. This company restarted operations and worked the claim until 1932, when it was finally abandoned due to the fear of undermining the town of St Bathans. Natural drainage from the surrounding hills filled the hole with water and created the present day lake. The Blue Lake is a key feature of modern-day St. Bathans and is used for swimming, fishing, bodyboarding, and kayaking.",['Lakes of Otago']
35307809,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35307809,Bogdan Saray,"Boğdan Sarayi (Turkish for ""Palace of Bogdania (Moldavia)"") was an Eastern Orthodox church in Turkey's largest city, Istanbul. Erected in the Byzantine era, its original dedication is unknown. In the Ottoman era the small edifice, being dedicated to St. Nicholas of Myra, was known as Agios Nikólaos tou Bogdansarághi (). and was part of the Istanbul residence of the Moldavian ""hospodar""′s legation to the Ottoman Porte. The building - whose parts above ground have almost completely disappeared - is a minor example of Byzantine architecture in Constantinople.          The remains of the church lie in Istanbul, in the district of Fatih, in the neighborhood () of Salmatomruk, not far from Edirnekapı (the ancient Gate of Charisius), 250 m. east of the museum of Chora and 100 m north of the Kefeli Mosque, both former Byzantine religious buildings. The ruins of the edifice are hardly accessible, as of 2012, as they are enclosed in a tire shop at ""Draman Caddesi 32"".          The building was erected on the slope of the sixth hill of Constantinople which overlooks the Golden Horn. Nothing is known about the edifice in the Byzantine Age, but due to its position it was likely an annex of the monastery of ""St. John the Baptist in the Rock"" (, pr. ""Hagios Ioannis Prodromos en ti Petra""), one of the largest monasteries of Constantinople, where, among other relics, the instruments of the Passion of Christ were kept. Nevertheless, due to its small dimensions it is not likely that the building was the ""katholikon"" (main church) of the monastery. According to some sources it was erected in twelfth century, during the Komnenian age, while for others it is a Palaiologan foundation of the fourteenth century. Its north-south orientation shows that it was originally erected not as a church, but rather as a funerary chapel.          After the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453, in sixteenth century the chapel became part of the large land estate bought by the ""hospodar"" of Moldavia to host his envoys in Istanbul, and named accordingly ""Boğdan Sarayi"" (""Moldavian Palace""). In this respect, its usage as private chapel of a patrician house represents a rarity in the Ottoman city. At the beginning of the eighteenth century the complex - a coveted property because the high border wall protected it by fires - was leased by the Sultan as residence for several foreign envoys, among them the Swedish ambassadors to the Ottoman Porte P. Strasburg and C. Rolomb, who sojourned in Istanbul in 1634 and 1657/58 respectively. In June 1760 the Phanariote John Callimaches endowed it to the Russian monastery of St. Pantaleon on Mount Athos. The complex burned down in the fire of 1784, and afterward the land was only used as a market garden. The possession of the church by the Athos monastery was confirmed again by relatives of Callimaches in January 1795 and August 1814, but the Russian monks showed little interest in the church's restoration, possibly because of the state of war between the Russian Empire and the Sublime Porte. In the nineteenth century the edifice steadily decayed and after the 1894 Istanbul earthquake fell into ruin. In 1918 a German archaeologist pursued clandestine excavations and found in the crypt three unnamed tombs. In the second half of the 20th century the remains of the building were enclosed in a shanty (), and today—lying inside a tire shop—they are hardly accessible. As of 2012 the parts above ground have almost disappeared, and only the crypt still exists.          The edifice had a rectangular plan, with sides of 6.20 m and 3.50 m, and was originally composed of two storeys, consisting of an above ground chapel and a subterranean crypt. The chapel was surmounted by a dome with pendentives insisting on two transverse arches across the walls, and ended towards North with a Bema and a polygonal apse adorned externally with niches, while the crypt was surmounted by a barrel vault and had also a simple apse. The edifice's brickwork consisted of courses of three or four rows of white stones alternating with a row of red bricks, obtaining a chromatic effect typical of the late Byzantine period. Its north-south orientation suggests the building's use as a funerary chapel, rather than as a church, since churches in Constantinople were almost always oriented in east-west direction. The attested past existence of remains of walls perpendicular to the structure indicates the possibility that this was part of a larger complex, most likely the monastery of St. John of Petra, one of the largest monasteries of Constantinople.","['14th-century Eastern Orthodox church buildings', 'Fatih', 'Byzantine sacred architecture', 'Byzantine art', 'History of Moldavia (1504\xe2\x80\x931711)']"

Wealthy or royal families hosted feasts for the purpose of gaining loyalty and a strong image that would help them politically or socially in the future. People of every social status hosted feasts as a celebration of family and life.          There were two main types of feasts, as discussed by Lisa J. LeCount and suggested by Dietler, diacritical exclusionary events and inclusionary events. Diacritical feasts were hosted by the wealthy and powerful, with only a strict list of other elite guests. These feasts were to demonstrate differences in social status and ensure that other members of society knew who had the power. This is evident with royals, politicians and the elite gaining loyalty through hosting feasts or performing rituals. Inclusionary feasts were held to promote solidarity and equality among the entire community. The invitation list for these feasts was broader and the event was larger and in a public setting. Inclusionary feasts were celebrations by the community as a whole. The cuisine for inclusionary feasts was similar to that of daily meals, whereas for diacritical feasts the cuisine was higher end and meant to impress the guests. Feasts differed slightly throughout eras and various societies in Mesoamerica.          Feasts in Maya society were composed of three parts: 1) worshiping of an ancestor by presenting offerings, 2) the sacrificing of the offerings, and 3) the consumption of foods that were blessed by the gods. The Maya hosted feasts for various reasons such as to celebrate marriages, deaths, health, various life events, farming celebrations, and holidays. Studies of the Late Classic Maya demonstrate a connection between feasting and politics. Maya feasting seems to have been very competitive among elites and royals who were trying to gain political loyalty by hosting the most extravagant feast with lavish foods and items. Ethnographic and ethnohistoric data shows that Late Classic Maya feasts were segmented into two corresponding parts: a private religious part and then a public festival. The private religious section was focused on gods, family, and ancestor worship while the public festival was often political or social. Rain ceremonies are an example of the segmented feasts that the Maya hosted.          Public feasting in Late Classic Maya society included the community as a whole, but still celebrated the elites and royals. Sixteenth Century Yucatec Maya display evidence of public feasting for two occasions. They celebrated marriages or ancestors with feasts, but also hosted a feast simply for building and maintaining relationships, which required all guests of the feast to then host their own feast in the near future. Feasts of the Yucatec seemed to have occurred on every social level and all heads of the families had to host feasts at times of rites of passages for their family members in order to maintain the social honor and status of their family. The men plan the feast while the women prepare foods with their other female family members. Each family makes lots of food to create a giant festival for the community which often include markets, bullfights, fireworks, dancing, and obviously drinking and eating.          Rain ceremonies are an example of the feasts that the Modern Yucatec Maya host and they demonstrate both the religious and the public parts of feasts. The ceremony takes three days to complete all the ritual activities, with the first two days being confined to only a small number of the community members. On the last day of the ritual the public is involved. On the first day, members of the community who ritual specialists construct an altar near the plaza where the ceremony will take place. On day two sacred food is offered to the gods at dawn, noon, three, seven and twice more sometime before two in the morning. Once those sacrifices are over, the people who participated in the ritual eat the sacrificed foods. After all of the very religious activities take place, the public festival is held and is meant to be a time for friends, family and eating.          Food was a very important and central aspect of many royal events and activities. For palace sponsored feasts, cooks prepared all of the food while noblewomen supervised the kitchen staff. The Mayas had a strong belief in animatism and LeCount thinks that they may have believed that when Mayan cooks prepared the feasts with maize and ka’kaw, that they were animated by the supernatural. Elite cooking differed from commoners’ cooking because of the skills and knowledge that the cooks had which allowed the meals to become sacred or symbolic.          At Xunantunich, Belize, archeological evidence of food serving vessels shows a distinction between vessels used at private and public feasts. Different serving platters were found that suggest certain vessels were used to serve sacred feasting foods and others were used for daily or more public events. Elite members indulged with polychrome plates and vases and had a higher frequency of serving bowls and platters. Common household ruins show less evidence of serving bowls and vases and LeCount suggests that they may have used small gourds to offer foods to the gods.          Tamales were a main dish of daily meals as well as a common ritual food in the central Maya lowlands. Deer, turkey, dog and other meats were saved for public festivals. Sacred foods and festival foods were different to symbolize the difference between community and an individual. Foods at feasts were presented as a sacred item and sacrificed to the gods. Maize is thought to evoke rain functions of the gods and to symbolize purity and divinity which made it a good sacrificial food for the gods. Maize was also a typical festival food along with tamales, tortillas, chicken, pig, chocolate and rum. The Yucatec Maya served chocolate at their weddings and baptisms. Cacao is not served at religious events, but is often at political or social gatherings. Cacao seeds are important because they are used in the negotiation of marriages. At public ceremonies freshwater snails, jutes, were eaten. The elites tended to eat ritual foods such as tamales and chocolate more often than commoners. Modern Day Mayan officials or elite consume chocolate drinks in private rituals to form social and political relationships.          Feasting occurred on a wide variety of social scales and contexts in Aztec society. They were held as celebrations of births, deaths, marriages or other events. The feasts included activities such as gift exchanges, human sacrifices, incense burning, speeches, plays, and of course eating and drinking. Royal and noble houses entertained and hosted feasts at scheduled times such as to distribute foods and money to the kingdom’s staff and administrative workers. Both kingdoms and common households held feasts to celebrate religious events and life events of their family (Smith 2003).           Aztec Codices show depictions of public-religious feasts, elite feasts hosted by the ruler, and home celebrations. Most feasts included some type of ritual activity, but there were some feasts that were more religious and ritual than others. At these ritual feasts the foods are not just offered to the gods, but are consumed at a particular time throughout the ceremony. When worshiping death gods, such as Mictlantecuhtli, human flesh is consumed around the temple of the ritual.          Feasts were a large part of political interaction of the elite because they served as a way to gain loyal allies that would back them in political competitions. The dishes and vessels that the food was served in showed the status of the elite and was very important to the power and competition of the host. Feasts held by royalty or nobles included high quality foods to emphasis their social status.          Aztec rulers hosted feasts and dances in order to bring young warriors together or to celebrate the success of a warrior. The feasts made the warriors’ job look appealing and rewarding. Only rulers of capitals that received tributes could directly reward the warriors with feasts and events, whereas rulers of those communities who had to pay tribute did not have the resources to spend on the warriors.          Pulque, a fermented drink that is made from sap of the maguey plant was consumed often at Aztec rituals and feasts, but usually only at night. Codices also picture alcoholic drinks, tortillas, tamales and cacao. Meat stews, tamales, and maize, which was believed to be a link between the sun and people and to carry the sun’s energy, were all consumed at feasts.          Food could have been served in either ceramic or stone vessels or gourds and baskets. Pulque was served in vessels that were decorated with symbols, such as half suns, skulls and cross bones, which represented night, disorder, and destruction. There were some specific pulque vessels that were only used during ceremonies or rituals, such as the “stone rabbit vessel”. The rabbit vessel symbolized the relationship of the moon, rabbits, and pulque and was only used during celebrations of Ometochtli (“Two Rabbit”) which was an important day of the 260-day calendar.","['Mesoamerican society', 'Mesoamerican diet and subsistence']"

By 1880 cricket was well established in St. Petersburg, with British diplomats and merchants challenging the British managers and foremen of the textile mills in an annual match. By 1895 there were four cricket clubs in St. Petersburg.          The Communist Revolution of 1917 put paid to the spread of cricket in Russia as it was seen as a game of the ""bourgeois"" and playing it was discouraged. With the British moving out of St. Petersburg following the Revolution, the game quickly died with them.          Cricket Russia was founded in 2004 by Ashwani Chopra and Mohanjeet Singh Arora with the help of cricket lovers like Vineet Arora, Manish Rana, Samar Shakeel and many others.

29900143,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29900143,Gustav Adolf Jebsen,"Gustav Adolf Jebsen (30 January 1884 – 20 January 1951) was a Norwegian industrialist.          He was born in Bergen as the youngest son of factory owner and ship-owner Peter Jebsen (1824–1892) and Sophie Catharina Sundt (1849–1912). He was a brother of Kristian Gerhard Sundt Jebsen and maternal grandson of Christian Gerhard Ameln Sundt. In 1917 he married attorney's daughter Lilla Døscher. He was a granduncle of Kristian Gerhard Jebsen and Atle Jebsen, and an uncle of Kristian Jebsen.          Jebsen finished education in machine engineering at Bergen technical school at the age of seventeen, and studied chemistry at the Technische Hochschule Hannover and the Royal Technical College of Charlottenburg. He took the doctorate in Zurich in 1905 with the thesis ""Zur Kenntnis der Phenoxymucobrom- und Chlorsäure als aromatische Verbindungen"". From 1905 to 1906 he studied at Sorbonne.          In 1906 he was hired in Sam Eyde's company Elektrokemisk. Together with Peder Farup he discovered and innovated the use of titanium dioxide as the pigment titanium white; together with the exploitation of the Søderberg electrode, this was the most important innovation during Jebsen's time.          The process of producing titanium white was figured out in 1914. Before that, Jebsen had become chief executive officer of Elektrokemisk in 1912. In 1916 he became chairman of the new company Titan Co. which produced titanium dioxide. In 1919 he briefly served as the first president of the Federation of Norwegian Industries. During the post-World War I economic crisis he had to leave Elektrokemisk in 1920, but became chief executive officer of Titan Co. in 1924. The shares in Titan Co. plummeted until being bought in 1927 by the American corporation National Lead along with the patent rights for titanium white. Jebsen was hired in National Lead, and worked out of Paris, from 1929 as chief executive of Titan Co. Inc in Europe. The corporation included companies such as Titangesellschaft in Germany and British Titan Products.          In 1940 Jebsen moved from Paris to New York City. In 1943 Nygaardsvold's Cabinet, exiled from Norway because of the war, named industrial committees consisting of expatriates in London and New York, and Jebsen worked for the New York-based committee. For his work here he was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav after the war, in 1946. He died in January 1951 in London.","['1884 births', '1951 deaths', 'People from Bergen', 'Norwegian chemical engineers', 'Norwegian businesspeople', 'Norwegian expatriates in Germany', 'Norwegian expatriates in Switzerland', 'Norwegian expatriates in France', 'Norwegian expatriates in the United States', 'Norwegian people of World War II']"

It was previously known as the 5th King Edward's Own Probyn's Horse, which was a regular cavalry regiment of the British Indian Army. It was formed in 1921 by the amalgamation of the 11th King Edward's Own Lancers (Probyn's Horse) and the 12th Cavalry.          The 11th King Edward's Own Lancers (Probyn's Horse) was raised on 1 August 1857 by Captain Frederick Wale during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and served at Lucknow. Captain Wale was killed in action on 1 March 1858, while leading the regiment in the pursuit of rebels, and was replaced by Major Dighton Probyn, VC. In 1860 the regiment was dispatched to China to take part in the Second Opium War. It participated in the advance on Peking and returned to India in 1861 with a good reputation. The regiment saw service in the Second Afghan War of 1878-80 and then took part in the Black Mountains Expedition; it went to Chitral and formed part of the Malakand Field Force. During the First World War, the regiment served in Mesopotamia.          The 12th Cavalry was also raised during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, by Captain PR Hockin in October 1857. The cavalry committed a war crime by massacring ""hundreds"" people at Mahua Dabar in 1857. It formed part of the 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and served in the Second Afghan War of 1878-80. During the First World War, the regiment fought in the Mesopotamian Campaign.          After the First World War, the number of Indian cavalry regiments was reduced from thirty-nine to twenty-one. However, instead of disbanding the surplus units, it was decided to amalgamate them in pairs. This resulted in renumbering and renaming the entire cavalry line. The 11th King Edward’s Own Lancers (Probyn’s Horse) and the 12th Cavalry were amalgamated at Meerut on 28 August 1921 to form 5th King Edward's Own Probyn's Horse. The uniform of Probyn's Horse was blue with scarlet facings. The new regiment's badge consisted of the Prince of Wales's plumes. Its class composition was one squadron each of Punjabi Muslims, Sikhs and Dogras. The regiment was mechanised in 1940. During the Second World War, the regiment served with great distinction in Burma. On the Partition of India in 1947, Probyn's Horse was allotted to Pakistan. In 1956, Pakistan became a republic and all titles pertaining to British royalty were dropped. The regiment's new designation was 5 Horse, although informally, it continues to be known as the Probyn's Horse.

He remained in the Royal Air Force until 1937, and returned to service during World War II in administrative roles.          John Leacroft born on 4 November 1888, the son of Dr John William Leacroft. He was educated at Aldenham School before going up to Pembroke College, Cambridge. He first joined the British Armed Forces when he was commissioned as a second lieutenant for service with the senior division of the University of Cambridge Officers' Training Corps on 3 February 1909, but he resigned this commission on 1 November the same year.          Leacroft joined the Army Service Corps with the outbreak of war in 1914, and served with them in France and Egypt. He had been promoted to captain by the time he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in 1915.          Leacroft was originally posted as an observer with No. 14 Squadron RAF in Egypt in 1916. He saw action during the Senussi Uprising and the second Turkish attack on the Suez Canal as part of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. After receiving pilot training he was appointed a Flying Officer on 20 March 1917, and posted to No. 19 Squadron RAF to fly Spad VIIs in May 1917, just as low-level ground attack sorties were being introduced in the lead up to the Battle of Messines. He scored his first victory on 17 June 1917. He tallied one each in July and August, and a double on 1 September to become an ace. By the end of the month he was a double ace. He had been appointed a Flight Commander on 22 July 1917. After four more triumphs in October, he was withdrawn from the front. Two of his October victories came in support of Allied troops during the Third Battle of Ypres, when on other occasions he carried a box of 25 lb bombs in his cockpit, as the Spad had no bomb racks. For these missions, he was awarded the Military Cross on 27 October 1918, the citation, published the following March, read:          When he returned for another tour of duty in early 1918, 19 Squadron had become the first unit to be equipped with the new Sopwith Dolphin. The squadron returned to operations on 13 February 1918. There followed a period of teething problems with the new aircraft. To add to these difficulties, the Dolphins were attacked by fellow British pilots because the unfamiliar Dolphin was assumed to be German.          Leacroft drove down two Albatros D.Vs on 15 March 1918 with his new aircraft. Then the Allied forces were faced with the German Spring Offensive. He followed his earlier March victories by burning a Pfalz D.III out of the air on 23 March; the following day saw another double victory by Leacroft. On 27 March he carried out a desperate ground attack mission against German troops using a road near Albert, Somme, this was quoted in the official British history, ""The War in the Air"" as an example of the tactics used to stop the offensive, and earned him a Bar to his MC, awarded on 22 June 1918. The citation read:          Victories on 12 April and 2 May rounded out his list of wins. He had survived being shot down twice. In turn, he had destroyed ten enemy aircraft; two of those wins had been shared with other pilots. Leacroft had also driven down out of control a dozen opponents. He ranked second out of the 20 aces in his squadron. Many of his initial combats had come against members of Richthofen's Flying Circus. His Squadron Commander in 1918, E. R. ""Toby"" Pretyman, described him as ""an outstanding pilot and the best flight commander on the Western Front in his time"". He was presented with both his MC and Bar by King George V in an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 September 1918.          Leacroft had been granted a permanent commission in the Royal Air Force on its formation in 1918, and he continued his career after the war, taking the new RAF rank of flight lieutenant. His first post-war duty was as a flying instructor at the new RAF College Cranwell from 1920 to 1922, he was then posted to RAF Iraq Command where he would stay until 1924. On 1 January 1924, he was promoted to squadron leader. Later in 1924 he took command of No. 17 Squadron at RAF Hawkinge. He commanded the squadron until 1928 when he was posted as chief flying instructor with No. 3 Flying Training School at RAF Grantham. After two years there he was posted to RAF Halton in 1930, and after promotion to wing commander on 1 January 1932, took charge of administration at No. 1 School of Technical Training there in February 1933, commanding No. 1 Apprentice Wing.          On 15 June 1937 it was announced that he would be the next station commander at RAF Thornaby, and on 2 July 1937, he was promoted to group captain. Thornaby had previously housed No. 9 Flying Training School, but now took in reconnaissance squadrons of No. 16 Group, RAF Coastal Command. Leacroft served until his retirement on 1 December 1937.          He was still in the Reserve of Air Force Officers on 12 June 1939, when he was recalled to duty as a squadron leader. He returned to the active list as a wing commander on 1 September 1939. In 1942 he was appointed president of the Air Crew Selection Board, then based at Cardington, Bedfordshire. He retired again on 19 April 1945. In retirement, he settled in Bexhill-on-Sea where he died on 26 August 1971.          Leacroft married Gladys, daughter of George Underhill Cuddon in 1926. Gladys lived until 22 March 1977, when she died in Clifton, Bristol, a requiem mass was held at Clifton Cathedral on 29 March. They were survived by their only daughter, Diana.          Leacroft was a noted sportsman in his younger days. Before World War I, he hunted regularly with the Belvoir Hunt (among others). Between the wars, he represented the RAF at cricket, polo and shooting—competing at Bisley.","['British World War I flying aces', '1888 births', '1971 deaths', 'Royal Air Force officers', 'Royal Army Service Corps officers', 'Royal Air Force personnel of World War II', 'Royal Flying Corps officers', 'Alumni of Pembroke College, Cambridge', 'People from Derby', 'Recipients of the Military Cross']"

He was a prominent literary figure in the Arabic-speaking world during the 20th century. Some of Halasa’s most influential novels include ""al-Dhahik"" (Laughter), ""al-Su’al"" (The Question), and ""Sultana"".          He was also a long-time member of the Communist Party, no matter what country he was living in. Halasa’s views awarded him a life of exile, spending many years in Iraq, Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon. He died in Damascus at the relatively young age of 57, after which his body was returned to Jordan, where he had not been for 34 years (he left Jordan in 1955).          As someone with great command of literary technique and theory, on top of his exceptionally fluid style, Halasa’s writings combine smooth reading with complex structuring. This was because he had the ability to draw on diverse narrative techniques and literary tradition. According to comparative literature professor Walid Hamarneh, Halasa wanted to ""[utilize] modern and post-modern techniques in novel writing, while at the same time preserving the great insights and creative achievements of the nineteenth-century realists.""           Ghalib Halasa was born in 1932, in a mostly Christian village called Ma'in, within the Madaba governorate of Jordan. No one knows for sure on which day he was born, but most agree that he was either born on the 3rd or the 18th of December. Fairly early in life, Halasa began reading books in Arabic, French, and English, while also demonstrating strong writing skills at the Christian Mutran boarding school for boys. Specifically, Halasa read a great deal about Marxism, politics, and American literature. This interest in American literature manifests later in Halasa's life when he translates into Arabic a biography about William Faulkner, and J.D. Salinger's ""The Catcher in the Rye.          Following high school, Halasa attended the American University of Beirut, where he received his B.A. in Journalism. For two years, while at the university, Halasa split his time between studying at the American University of Beirut and teaching at a school in Amman, Jordan. While in college, Halasa also became a member of the Communist Party. This resulted in jail-time, including almost two years in a Baghdad prison.          Forbidden from living in Jordan, Halasa headed to Egypt in 1955. He studied at the American University in Cairo, where he also taught, and began writing articles on various literary topics. Later, Halasa began translating for both the Chinese Embassy and the German Press Agency. Throughout this time, Halasa remained interested and engaged in socialist ideologies and politics. After attending protests against Anwar Sadat, Halasa saw time in prison once more, and eventually banishment from Egypt in 1976. After exile from Egypt, he spent time in numerous countries: Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Germany, and lastly Syria, where he died.          In 1982, Halasa fought alongside the Palestinians in the Lebanon War.          Halasa authored two collections of short stories, seven novels, four books of literary criticism, and three other books of various natures. He also translated several books from English. Unfortunately, much of his work remains untranslated.","['Arabic literature', 'Jordanian writers', 'Literary critics of Arabic', '1932 births', '1989 deaths']"

This temporary station was named Godley Toll Bar and closed on 11 December 1842 when the line was extended to Broadbottom.          Godley East once had four platforms, two on the Manchester–Glossop Line and two linking the Woodhead Line with the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) route to Apethorne Junction (Woodley). The branch opened in 1866, after which Godley became known as Godley Junction. The CLC platforms were only ever lightly used. The station and sidings were controlled by a single mechanical signal box which was located at the east end of the 'up' (Hadfield) platform.          The electrification of the Woodhead line in 1954 gave Godley a strategic importance that it retained until the through route to Sheffield closed in 1981. Godley was one of the locations where trains to and from the Liverpool district changed from diesel or steam to electric traction, and vice versa. In steam days there was a large turntable situated on the CLC branch. The turntable pit is still in existence and remains in remarkably good condition and free of debris.          The station was renamed from ""Godley Junction"" to ""Godley"" on 6 May 1974.          On 7 July 1986, a new station called Godley was opened on the site of the original Godley Toll Bar station, and the original station was renamed Godley East. With the addition of Hattersley serving more closely the nearby council estate, train services were gradually reduced and the station formally closed on 27 May 1995.           The main platforms remain intact, although now largely overgrown. The platforms on the Hadfield line are fenced off; however, from the now cycle track which runs along the former line linking to Stockport, the remains of the other platforms are visible. The derelict footbridge was removed during the late 2000s.","['Disused railway stations in Tameside', 'Former Great Central Railway stations', 'Former Cheshire Lines Committee stations', 'Railway stations opened in 1841', 'Railway stations closed in 1995']"

Her husband was Emperor Taiwu.          She was a daughter of the Xia's founding emperor Helian Bobo (Emperor Wulie). In 428, during the reign of her brother Helian Chang, Emperor Taiwu led his Northern Wei forces to capture the Xia capital Tongwan (統萬, in modern Yulin, Shaanxi), and while Helian Chang fled, she was captured along with most nobles and officials of Xia. She and her two sisters were all taken as Emperor Taiwu's imperial consorts. In 432, she was created empress, presumably after being able to pass the traditional Tuoba tribe test by being able to forge a gold statue.          Little is known about Empress Helian's life during her husband's reign. She did not bear him any sons. In 452, he was assassinated by his eunuch Zong Ai, who claimed that, by her orders, Emperor Taiwu's son Tuoba Yu the Prince of Nan'an should be made emperor, bypassing Emperor Taiwu's apparent intended heir, Tuoba Jun, the son of Tuoba Huang the Crown Prince, who had died in 451. Tuoba Yu honored her as empress dowager, but there is no particular evidence to suggest that Empress Helian was actually involved in Zong's conspiracy. Later in 452, Zong assassinated Tuoba Yu as well, but the officials then overthrew Zong and put Tuoba Jun on the throne as Emperor Wencheng, and he honored her as grand empress dowager.

457922,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=457922,Pachuco,"Pachuco refers to a particular old school subculture of Chicanos and Mexican-Americans associated with zoot suits, street gangs, nightlife, and flamboyant public behavior. The idea of the pachuco – a zoot-suited, well-dressed, street-connected flamboyant playboy of Hispanic/Latino heritage – originated in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, had moved north, following the line of migration of Mexican railroad workers (""traqueros"") into Los Angeles, where it developed further.          A pachuca is the female counterpart, often idealized as a beautiful Chicana woman in extravagant evening dress or a female version of the zoot suit, out with a pachuco boyfriend for a night on the town. Pachucas broke taboos of their time by wearing men's-style pants sometimes and appearing in public often with their pachuco boyfriends; at the time, a ""good woman"" was considered to have her place in the home. They defied male/female stereotypes and roles in Mexican-American culture in much the same way flappers had in European-American culture in the 1920s.          The origin of the term ""pachuco"" is uncertain, but one theory connects it to the city of El Paso, Texas, which was sometimes referred to as ""Chuco Town"" or ""El Chuco."" People migrating to El Paso would say, in Spanish, that they were going ""pa' El Chuco."" These migrants became known as pachucos.          The name ""Pachuco"" is quite possibly derived from the name of the city of Pachuca, the capital of Mexico's Hidalgo state. There have long been migrants from Hidalgo state living in Texas.          Another theory says that the word derives from ""pocho"", a derogatory term for a Mexican born in the United States who has lost touch with the Mexican culture. The word is also said to mean ""punk"" or ""troublemaker"". Yet another theory is put forth by author Laura L. Cummings who postulates a possible indigenous origin of the term. The founder of the ""Pachuco"" subculture was a Mexican comedian and film actor named German Valdés better-known by his Artistic name ""Tin-Tan"". He introduced the Pachuco dress and slang throughout his Golden age-era films.          Connections have also been found between ""Pachucos"" and mixed civilians who lived near the Mexican-American border during the turn of the century, and between ""Pachucos"" and the poor soldiers who fought in the Mexican Revolution in the armies of Pancho Villa.          Pachucos called their slang Caló (sometimes called ""pachuquismo""), a unique argot that drew on the original Spanish Gypsy Caló, Mexican Spanish, the New Mexican dialect of Spanish, and American English, employing words and phrases creatively applied. To a large extent, Caló went mainstream and is one of the last surviving vestige of the Pachuco, often used in the lexicon of some urban Latinos in the United States to this day. The influence of Valdés is responsible for the assimilation of several Caló terms into Mexican slang.          The Mexican Nobel laureate Octavio Paz writes in the essay, ""The ""Pachuco"" and Other Extremes"" that the Pachuco phenomenon paralleled the zazou subculture in World War II-era Paris in style of clothing, music favored (jazz, swing, and jump blues), and attitudes. Although there was no known link between the two subcultures, they both are most certainly derivative localized blends of American pop culture in the United States.          Pachuco culture in America was at its height during World War II. The Wartime Productions Board in 1942 thought it necessary to cut back on fabric consumption, so they enacted regulations on the amount of fabric used for suits. This enactment targeted Pachucos in particular because of the excess fabric used in their zoot suits. Pachucos boldly chose not to follow these regulations, demonstrating rebellious attitudes and pride in their culture. Pachucos continued to flaunt zoot suits, now attained through bootleg tailors. As a result, these flashy zoot suits were seen as unpatriotic by other Americans. This controversial series of events helped shape Pachuco culture, and zoot suits became a symbol of cultural pride among Mexican-Americans. It didn't all end well, however, as this also led to rising tension between Pachucos and other Americans, playing a part in the start of the 1944 Zoot Suit Riots.          The pachuco subculture declined in the 1960s, evolving into the Chicano style. This style preserved some of the pachuco slang while adding a strong political element characteristic of the late 1960s American life.          In the early 1970s, a recession and the increasingly violent nature of gang life resulted in an abandonment of anything that suggested dandyism. Accordingly, Mexican-American gangs adopted a uniform of T-shirts and khakis derived from prison uniforms, and the pachuco style died out. However, the zoot suit remains a popular choice of formal wear for urban and rural Latino youths in heavily ethnic neighborhoods. It is typically worn at a prom, or in some cases, at informal Latino university commencement ceremonies.          The "" is used in Costa Rica to define Costa Rican slang. It nevertheless differs from the Mexican slang.          In Costa Rica the term ""pachuco"" refers to someone who has common habits and who is often very rude. In Costa Rica the word pachuco refers to a person who has manners that are socially unacceptable and often uses shocking language when speaking. Pachuco is also a pejorative name given to certain colloquial words and expressions. Some consider pachuco and its pachuquísmos to be Costa Rica's second language.          Pachuco style was a dominating trend among Mexican-American youth in the 1930s-40s. Pachucos became known for their distinguished look, dialogue, and actions. Pachucos dressed in recognizable Zoot suits, and often styled their hair into ducktails. Things like decorative chains and tattoos were also sometimes part of the pachuco look. The unique speech of pachucos was a very important element of their defined style. Consisting of creative phrases and some English words, Caló (Chicano) was a very popular form of speech among pachucos. Pachucos were seen as gangsters in the eyes of other Americans, because of the activities they participated in. They often carried concealed weapons and involved in criminal activities such as vandalism and gang related misdemeanor.          The ""Pachuca"", the female counterpart of the Pachuco, had an aesthetic sensibility as strong as the male zoot suiter. The Pachuca's hairstyle tended to be a high ""coif"" or bouffant, with the hair put up in some way (a more pronounced version of the typical hair style of the time), sometimes using hair grease. Her makeup was heavy, particularly the lipstick. The preferred colors of clothing were black and gray. One very loud version of the Pachuca look entailed wearing the masculine zoot suit, albeit with modifications to fit the female form. This was very subversive at the time because of long-held gender roles that dictated how a person should dress. Sometimes, she donned the standard heavy gold pocket chain. Another variation involved a sweater or coat - often a variant on the male zoot-suit finger-tip jacket - over knee-length skirts, plus fishnet stockings or bobby socks and platform shoes. Extravagant dresses were and are also common among pachucas. Like the entire culture, the fashion aesthetic revolved around the concept of ""see and be seen"".          This style was associated with gang membership and activity. The idea of gang membership and gang activity came from the Zoot Suit Riots that took place in Southern California. The negative image of the male zoot suiter as a ""violent gangster"" naturally extended to the Pachuca as well. The promiscuous image came from the Pachuca's high public visibility and patronage of nightlife with pachucos. The Pachuca style contrasted with the traditional Latino-American image of femininity at the time which held that the ""good"" minority woman stayed in the home.          The Pachuca's challenge to the dominant perception of femininity came during the period between the advent of women's suffrage in 1920 and the upsurge in feminist activism of the 1960s and 1970s.","['Chicano', 'History of subcultures', 'Youth culture']"

1085255,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1085255,Jetex,"The Jetex motor is a type of solid-fuel rocket motor produced for use as a powerplant for model aircraft. Originally developed in 1947, by Wilmot, Mansour & Company Ltd of Southampton, it was first demonstrated to the modelling press in early 1948, and was available to the public in June 1948, when ""Aeromodeller"" featured Jetex power on its front cover. The first motors were the Jetex 100 and 200, with the more powerful Jetex 350 following in November 1948. The most popular motor, the Jetex 50, was introduced in May 1949, along with kits for a model plane and model car using Jetex power.          Jetex motors are powered by a solid pellet of guanidine nitrate, which burns to release a variety of gases in copious volume, leaving no solid residue or ash. Thrust developed is fairly modest, suitable for horizontally launched flying models rather than vertically launched rockets. The exhaust gas is not excessively hot, which confers a safety advantage. Fuel and wick to ignite the pellets was manufactured by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). The engine casing was made of an aluminium alloy and was reusable, new fuel pellets and ignition wick being a consumable that could be bought and used in the engine.          Jetex power made a big impact in the late forties and early fifties, allowing new sorts of models, scale and duration, to be designed. Its popularity waned after the mid-fifties, and by the late 1970s was largely forgotten. Recently, there has been a reawakening of interest in Jetex; in the mid-1990s, a similar device called the Rapier was launched, and many old plans for Jetex powered models were dusted off and built with the new motors.          Compared with modern Estes-type rockets, the Jetex is quite different. It has a much gentler, cooler exhaust, so flight characteristics tend to feature gradual acceleration rather than firework-like performance. The cooler exhaust is easier to handle and does not require extensive flameproofing of the airframe. However, the fuel is more toxic and requires special handling to keep it dry and in working condition (the fuel is slightly deliquescent and will gradually absorb moisture from the atmosphere which quickly renders it inactive). As a result, Jetex were quite unreliable, often failing to ignite.","['Model rocketry', 'Rocket engines']"

In 1920, the year he completed his `Seated Nude', he exhibited alongside such major figures of modern art as Matisse and Braque, while from 1921 on he also exhibited alongside Juan Gris, Dufy, Chagall and Picasso.          By the early 1920s Galanis was famous in France and preparing for shows in Brussels, London, and New York. In 1920-21 he frequently exhibited in Paris and in 1922 his first one-man exhibition received the enthususiastic critical response that established his reputation. 'Seated Nude' was among the pictures exhibited, and in an introduction to the exhibition André Malraux described the artist's work as ""having the power to stir emotions equivalent to that of Giotto.""          This show established Galanis’ reputation as a painter and confirmed the favourable opinions already expressed on the quality of his work. Critics of his time paid much more attention to his figurative work than his landscapes, confirming the well-established view that Galanis’ first and foremost concern was his love for the human form.          Galanis received greater critical acclaim abroad in his lifetime than any other Greek modern artist of the early 20th century. The French state honoured him with the highest distinctions: full professor at the École des Beaux Arts in Paris and a lifelong member of the Académie française.          Having moved to Paris in 1900, living close to Montmartre for fifty years in a house which is now musée de Montmartre, Galanis developed his artistic talent beyond painting. He was also known for his illustrative wood engravings in books, such as the Limited Editions Club of Sophocles' ""Oedipus the King"" and the Cresset Press edition of John Milton's ""Paradise Lost"". The Limited Editions Club published 1500 signed copies in 1955 and the sister organization, Heritage Press, then reprinted unsigned volumes.          The most significant collection of Galanis' work can be found at the Teloglion Foundation at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, though examples can also be found in London's Tate Gallery.

It was forked from the FreeBSD ports collection in 1997 as the primary package management system for NetBSD. Since then it has evolved independently: in 1999, support for Solaris was added, later followed by support for other operating systems. DragonFly BSD, from release 1.4 to 3.4, used pkgsrc as its official packaging system. MINIX 3 and the Dracolinux distribution both include pkgsrc in their main releases.          There are multiple ways to install programs using pkgsrc. The pkgsrc bootstrap contains a traditional ports collection that utilizes a series of makefiles to compile software from source. Another method is to install pre-built binary packages via the pkg_add and pkg_delete tools. A high-level utility named ""pkgin"" also exists, and is designed to automate the installation, removal, and update of binary packages in a manner similar to APT or yum.          pkgsrc currently contains over 17000 packages (over 20000 including work-in-progress packages maintained outside the official tree) and includes most popular open source software.

22097588,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22097588,"Philippine presidential election, 2010","The Philippine presidential and vice presidential elections of 2010 were held on Monday, May 10, 2010. The ruling President of the Philippines, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, was barred from seeking re-election by the 1987 Constitution, thus necessitating an election to select the 15th President.          Incumbent Vice-President Noli de Castro was allowed to seek re-election though he could have possibly sought the presidency. As he didn't offer himself in any manner of candidacy at the election, his successor was determined as the 15th Vice President of the Philippines. Although most presidential candidates have running mates, the president and vice president are elected separately, and the winning candidates may be of different political parties.          This election was also the first time that the Commission of Elections (COMELEC) implemented full automation of elections, pursuant to Republic Act 9369, ""An act authorizing the Commission on Elections to use an Automated Election System in the May 11, 1998 National or Local Elections and in subsequent National And Local Electoral Exercises"".          The results of the congressional canvassing showed that Senator Benigno Aquino III of the Liberal Party won by a plurality, although he had won with the highest percentage of votes since 1986, but not enough to have the largest margin of victory, even in elections held after 1986.          Meanwhile, in the election for the vice-presidency, Makati Mayor Jejomar Binay of the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban) defeated Senator Mar Roxas of the Liberal Party in the second-narrowest margin in the history of vice presidential elections. Aquino and Binay were proclaimed in a joint session of Congress on June 9, and took their oaths on June 30, 2010. Roxas filed an electoral protest to the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET; the Supreme Court) on July 10, 2010.           The election is held every six years after 1992, on the second Monday of May. The incumbent president is term limited. The incumbent vice president may run for two consecutive terms. As Joseph Estrada, who was elected in 1998, was able to run in 2010, it is undetermined if the term limit is for life, or is only limited to the incumbent.          The plurality voting system is used to determine the winner: the candidate with the highest number of votes, whether or not one has a majority, wins the presidency. The vice presidential election is a separate election, is held on the same rules, and voters may split their ticket. Both winners will serve six-year terms commencing on the noon of June 30, 2016 and ending on the same day six years later.          The candidates are determined via political conventions of the different political parties. As most political parties in the Philippines are loosely structured, with most politicians switching parties from time to time, a person not nominated by a party may either run as an independent, get drafted by another party, or form their own party. The candidacy process is supervised by the Commission on Elections (usually referred by its abbreviation ""COMELEC"") which also regulates and holds the elections. It is not uncommon for the Commission to disqualify certain candidates as ""nuisance candidates"" or those candidates who have no capacity to mount a nationwide campaign. This usually limits the candidates to a small number. The campaign will run for three months, beginning in early February 2010 and ending on the eve of the election, the Vote Counting Machines will be tested and be booted up at 5 AM in the morning and the shading of candidates will be on 7:30 in the morning CNN Philippines source says.          The counting of votes is initially held in the individual voting precincts, which are all then tabulated for the different municipalities and cities, then to the provinces, and finally to Congress, which is the final canvasser of the votes. Election protests are handled by the Supreme Court, when it sits as the Presidential Electoral Tribunal.          The COMELEC-mandated election period for this election was from January 10 to June 9, 2010.          In the Philippines, the multi-party system is implemented. Sometimes a coalition of different parties are made notably this year are the Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino and PDP-LABAN, and Nacionalista Party and NPC. Each party hosts candidates who go through a nomination process to determine the presidential nominee for that party.          The list below is listed in the alphabetical order of the party:          The Philippines has two primary opinion polling companies: Social Weather Stations (SWS) and Pulse Asia. The following are the last released surveys prior to the election by SWS and Pulse Asia:          SWS conducted an exit poll. SWS's 2004 exit poll missed by a large margin the result.          According to the SWS exit poll, 45% of Muslims voted for Binay, while only 17% chose Roxas and 28% for Legarda. About 75% of the members of the Iglesia ni Cristo voted for Roxas. Despite having the endorsement of several Catholic bishops, de los Reyes only got 0.2% of the Catholic vote, while Aquino, despite being branded by some Catholic organizations as not pro-life, got 44%.          The candidate in each position with the highest amount of votes is declared the winner; there is no runoff. Congress shall canvass the votes in joint public session.          When there are two or more candidates who have an equal and highest amount of votes, Congress, voting separately via majority vote, will choose among the candidates who have an equal and highest amount of votes to be the president.          The Supreme Court shall ""be the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of the President or Vice President"".          There are several parallel tallies, with the Congressional canvass the official tally. The COMELEC used the election returns from the polling precincts; the Congress as the national board of canvassers will base their official tally from the certificates of canvass from the provinces and cities, which were derived from the election returns. The accredited citizen's arm, the Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV) also used the election returns from the polling precincts. In theory, all tallies must be identitcal.          Congress in joint session as the National Board of Canvassers convened in the Batasang Pambansa Complex in Quezon City, the home of the House of Representatives. Only a committee canvassed the votes, with the same number of members from both the Senate and the House of Representatives.          On June 8, Congress finished canvassing all of the votes, with the final canvass showing that Aquino and Binay had won. Aquino and Binay were proclaimed as president-elect and vice president-elect in a joint session on June 9. The president-elect and vice president-elect were inaugurated on June 30, 2010.          In case a president has not been determined by June 30, the vice president-elect shall act as president until a president has been determined. If both positions have not yet been determined, the President of the Senate, or the Speaker of the House of Representatives if the former is unable to do so, shall act as president. Congress shall enact a law on who acts as president if neither of officials already stated are unable to do so.          The candidate with the highest number of votes wins the vice presidency. In case when two or more candidates have the highest number of votes, one of them shall be chosen by the vote of a majority of all the members of both Houses of the Congress, voting separately.          Margin of victory is less than 5% for the presidential election:          Margin of victory is less than 5% for the vice presidential election:          The COMELEC originally released results for president and vice president based from election returns but stopped in order not to preempt Congress. The COMELEC held their tally at the Philippine International Convention Center at Pasay.          The PPCRV held their tally at the Pope Pius Center in Manila.          Source: Exit polls conducted by Pulse Asia          Source: Exit polls conducted by Pulse Asia          According to the Fair Elections Act, the COMELEC's cap on spending is 10 pesos per voter for each candidate and another 5 pesos per voter for one's political party; since there are about 50 million voters, a candidate can spend up to 500 million pesos and a party can spend an additional 250 million pesos.

Healthcare technician's primary position is to assist medical staff complete tasks around their assigned unit or clinic's and accommodate patient needs.          Healthcare technicians are typically found in specialty clinics, intensive care, emergency departments, or laboratory collection facilities. Technicians will perform basic cardiology reports such as, EKG's and will have basic understanding of bodily function. The technician is an integral member of the unit-based healthcare team, they contribute to the continuity of care by decreasing fragmentation through decentralization of selected diagnostic and therapeutic treatment modalities.          Healthcare technicians provide two levels of care, direct and indirect. Often, technicians are trained and qualified to complete specialty tasks and this varies depending on clinic needs. Healthcare technicians provide a key role in patient care and cleanliness of hospital units. Healthcare technicians or HCT are also known as Patient Care Technician (PCT) or Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA).HCT's objectives are to provide basic nursing care, use communication skills to assist patients to adapting to common health problems, provide continuity of care, demonstrate acceptance of responsibility for learning purposes, and proper demonstration for accountability purposes. HCT's can assist the medical team while evaluating patients on a routine basis within primary care clinics. They can be trained to ask emotional health questions/survey's to evaluate the standing of patients mental health. This screening measure performed by HCT's can help create awareness and assist in the diagnosis and prevention of patient depression.          Qualified members performing direct patient care can have the opportunity work directly with patients and assist with their care and well being. This type of care involves the following duties:          According to a recent article the following tasks met as the highest job priority for healthcare technicians: Blood draws, arterial gases, venous access through IV insertion, central line dressing changes, electrocardiograms, patient monitoring, oxygen requirements, breathing exercises, and vital signs. HCT's are at the forefront of healthcare and can assist in the addressing issues or concerns within the healthcare structure. They can be utilized to mention gaps or strengths when addressing chronic pain patients within the healthcare system. The empathetic approach that HCT's use while on the job can assist medical teams better care for patients facing chronic health illnesses.          Aside from routine patient care, healthcare technicians will complete many duties outside of direct care. The indirect care performed by healthcare technicians will ensure continuity of care. Technicians will maintain clinic or units with:          Although healthcare technicians perform several direct and indirect tasks, they also perform specialty duties. These duties are delegated to ensure clinic specific needs are met. These duties include:          Most allied health programs are of associate degree levels or state issued certification. A potential student will need to complete a certified program and a clinical externship. The duration of most programs is 10–24 weeks and vary with credit load.

Also, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has projected, 29% employment growth from 2012-2022.          There is a growing need for a cohort of compentent technicians to support the range of occupational health service delivery and to release nurses from some of the more routine tasks of their day-to-day work.          Most duties performed while working are distributed by several technicians. Although many tasks are at times stressful, one must complete these jobs effortlessly and without error. The most difficult task while working is successfully being able to manage multiple units (or offices) and be efficient. Throughout an 8 hour day a tech may be assigned to 1-4 different areas and have to have direct or indirect care with patients. Duties will often include lifting, prolonged standing, blood-draw, and patient bathing needs. Each job performed will have annual competencies completed to ensure patient safety standards are compliant.          Each technician is trained with levels of priority. This can be described as the time frame at which one completes certain tasks or duties. For example: a technician will be given blood cultures (a lab specimen collected to verify the growth of bacterium in the blood system.), routine lab collections, glucose testing, and equipment processing (cleaning of medical equipment). Depending on staffing levels a technician will have to determine which task will need completed first per priority level. This will be established by the technician based upon patient needs or volume of patients needing testing, staffing levels, and the efficiency level at which they can complete the most work.",['Allied health professions']

7407556,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7407556,Newport YMCA A.F.C.,"Newport YMCA Association Football Club are a football team based in the city of Newport, South Wales. They currently play in the Welsh Football League Second Division.          They were founded in 1973 with the merging of the Newport Central YMCA and Newport Pill YMCA sides and were elected to the Welsh Football League in 1978. Newport YMCA had good Welsh Cup results in the 2000s as they reached the Fifth Round of the competition on various occasions. This resulted in them facing off against three Welsh Premier League sides: Carmarthen Town, Welshpool Town & Bangor City.          Newport YMCA Football Club was formed in 1973 when the Newport Central YMCA and Newport Pill YMCA sides merged to form one club.          The merger took place as a result of a decision made by the Board of Management who were responsible for running the affairs of the YMCA in Newport at that time. They believed that it would be in the best interests of both clubs for them to merge and share facilities. After many months of negotiation the two sides, usually fierce rivals on the park, merged to form the one Club, Newport YMCA.          Prior to the merger both sides were successful teams in their own right. Pill YMCA playing in the higher standard Gwent Premier League and Central YMCA in the Newport & District League Premier X Division.          Pill YMCA who had moved onto an eight-acre ground at Mendalgief Road in 1955, boasted two football pitches and a rugby pitch, but suffered from poor changing facilities, whilst Central YMCA situated in the town centre, had better changing facilities, but no ground of their own. At the time of the merger Central YMCA ran five senior sides and Pill YMCA ran two senior sides and a range of junior sides.          The merger proved an instant success with the club running five senior teams plus junior teams from under-12s to under-18s. Cups and trophies came the clubs way on an annual basis.          In 1978 after winning the Gwent Premier League four times in succession they gained election to the Welsh Football League.          Under the management of Michael Carvell the club worked its way up to the Premier Division, which at that time was the highest level of football in South Wales. In 1980–81 the club made it to the final of the Welsh Intermediate Cup (formerly known as the Welsh Amateur Cup) only to lose the game 1–0 to Connah's Quay Nomads.          The pinnacle of success came when the side finished in 3rd place in the Premier Division in 1982–83, their highest-ever finish in the Welsh football pyramid. Despite this high finish the creation of the ‘National Division’ for season 1983–84 effectively demoted the YM, their lack of facilities costing them a place in the newly created division.          In 1990 The Board of Management at the YMCA decided to sell off the Central YMCA building and half of the land at Mendalgief Road, using the money to finance a new purpose-built facility in Pill. For one season the club were forced to play their home games at Somerton Park, home of Newport County, as uncertainty over the sale of the land and building work meant the club needed to find an alternative venue for home games.          After spending the 1990–91 season at Somerton Park the YM returned to their home at Mendalgief Road as the sale of the land failed to materialise, causing building work to be delayed. Unfortunately the uncertainty over events off the field transmitted itself to the football club and the retirement of older players plus the inability to attract new ones caused the club to suffer relegation at the end of the 1992–93 season.          The new building that was planned for 1991 eventually opened in January 2000 and this marked an upturn in the fortunes of the club. In season 2001–2002 the YMCA started their comeback back by winning the Division 3 championship. Two seasons later the club finished just one place below a promotion spot, but in season 2004–05 they secured a return to the top division of Welsh League football by finishing runners-up to Pontardawe in Division 2.          Newport YMCA have many local rivals in the city of Newport. Newport YMCA have in recent years enjoyed clashes with cross-city rivals Caerleon and Llanwern. During the 2008–2009 season, they began a rivalry with Cwmbran Town, who had previously been relegated from the Welsh Premier League.          At youth level Newport YMCA have a rivalry with Newport County but at senior level the teams do not compete in the same league system. The used to play each other in an annual preseason friendly. The last time they met was in 2004, twice.

The song soon became popular on Christian rock radio, charting at number one in February 2008. It was 2008's 14th most played song of the year on Christian contemporary hit radio.          The song is about having triumph and victory over past circumstances and has been described as ""anthemic"". The theme of ""Unbreakable"" was partially inspired by a fan's question asked on MySpace. It received generally positive reviews from critics and was GMA Dove Award-nominated in 2009 for Rock/Contemporary Song of the Year.          The band's style and theme changed between their debut album, ""The Healing of Harms"" (2006), and ""Unbreakable"". The first album was thematically based on ""trying to fight your way through circumstances"", while Fireflight's second project has a theme of triumph and being ""[victorious] over the things that used to control you"". According to the band members, the song ""Unbreakable"" represents that change between the two albums: ""now it's about finding power in your life"", said bassist Wendy Drennen.          The song is carried by an ""anthemic"" sound and the ""riveting vocals"" of lead vocalist Dawn Michele. Bassist Wendy Drennen said that ""Unbreakable"" was about ""overcoming a defeated mentality and finding the power to remain strong amid the landscape, not allowing fear to hold us back from having victory over the things that used to control us"". It is also lyrically based on the Biblical account of Jesus and the woman taken in adultery; the song's first line states, ""Where are the people that accused me?"" Richardson said, ""The people in charge were ready to kill her, and Jesus speaks up for her, changes their minds and makes them feel ashamed for accusing her ... She knows she’s guilty, and yet she’s suddenly free and given a second chance.""

It held the position for at least three weeks, and also charted at number 14 on ""R&Rs Christian contemporary hit radio (CHR) chart; it was the most-added song of the week on the CHR format in mid February. It reached a peak position on the ""Billboard"" Hot Christian Songs chart of number 20 in early April.          At the end of 2008 ""Unbreakable"" was the 14th most-played song of the year on Christian contemporary hit radio. In February 2009, it received a GMA Dove Award nomination for Rock/Contemporary Song of the Year.          The song was generally received well by critics. Jesus Freak Hideout editor John DiBiase called it a ""powerful anthem"" and said that the opening track was ""merely the tip of the iceberg"" for the album's quality among the other tracks. Bob Felberg of The Phantom Tollbooth was favorable towards the song, saying, ""'Unbreakable' ...is one of the strongest Christian rock songs in a long time, both in music and lyrics"", and that it featured ""a slinky-like guitar and strings interacting before slamming rhythms blow your hair straight back"". In response to ""Unbreakable"" being featured on NBC's ""Bionic Woman"", The Phantom Tollbooth's second reviewer Bert Saraco said, ""Mainstream attention is a wonderful thing, of course, but often signals a necessarily generic element to a project that sometimes sends out danger signals as to its artistic or creative potential."" Tony Cummings of ""Cross Rhythms"" magazine said that the song was ""excellent"".          The song's music video premiered on the Gospel Music Channel on March 29, 2008. The video primarily shows the band performing in a building with dark lighting, but also depicts three people in their separate difficulties. The first is a man who was involved in a car wreck. Next shown is a woman who has suffered hair loss from chemotherapy cancer treatment, and the third individual is a teenage girl who struggles with bulimia nervosa. At the end of the song, all three have a more relaxed countenance.          The song was nominated for a Dove Award for Rock/Contemporary Recorded Song of the Year at the 40th GMA Dove Awards.","['2007 singles', '2007 songs']"

It took place on 1 August 1993 at Donington Park.          6th pole of the season for Kevin Schwantz; Wayne Rainey highsides in practice—he loses two fingernails, gets a fracture in his spine and a concussion; he doesn’t qualify well.          Rainey gets the start.          Rainey has the lead from Alex Barros, Schwantz and Mick Doohan. Approaching the chicane, Doohan leaves the braking too late and slams into the back of Barros on his right, then falls to his left and takes out Schwantz. Schwantz looks injured. Rainey’s championship hopes suddenly look bright, with Carl Fogarty and Luca Cadalora behind him.          Fogarty is adjusting his front brakes on-the-fly; Cadalora comes past.          Àlex Crivillé, who’d been in a battle with Shinichi Itoh, crashes out.          Rainey and Cadalora at the front; Cadalora looks like he’s staying behind Rainey purposely, but then passes. Watching on the race monitors, team manager Kenny Roberts shakes his head at Cadalora’s disregard for Rainey’s championship struggle. It will be Cadalora’s first 500 win.          Fogarty looks to have a strong 3rd, but seems to be running out of gas and is pipped at the line by Niall Mackenzie.          Rainey is now 3 points behind Schwantz with 4 rounds to go.          Cadalora: “When I saw that Kevin was out and he didn’t get point (sic), I was thinking it was not big trouble, because 20 points more for Wayne. That’s good.” Had Cadalora stayed in 2nd, Rainey would be 2 points ahead, not 3 points behind.          Roberts: “I’m very happy for Luca, because to win a 500 grand prix for Luca is fantastic. But, I have to run the Marlboro Yamaha team, and for the team, it would have been better that Wayne won.

460642,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=460642,Equicontinuity,"In mathematical analysis, a family of functions is equicontinuous if all the functions are continuous and they have equal variation over a given neighbourhood, in a precise sense described herein. In particular, the concept applies to countable families, and thus ""sequences"" of functions.          The equicontinuity appears in the formulation of Ascoli's theorem, which states that a subset of ""C""(""X""), the space of continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space ""X"", is compact if and only if it is closed, pointwise bounded and equicontinuous. As a corollary, a sequence in ""C""(""X"") is uniformly convergent if and only if it is equicontinuous and converges pointwise to a function (not necessarily continuous a-priori). In particular, the limit of an equicontinuous pointwise convergent sequence of continuous functions ""f"" on either metric space or locally compact space is continuous. If, in addition, ""f"" are holomorphic, then the limit is also holomorphic.          The uniform boundedness principle states that a pointwise bounded family of continuous linear operators between Banach spaces is equicontinuous.          Let ""X"" and ""Y"" be two metric spaces, and ""F"" a family of functions from ""X"" to ""Y"".          The family ""F"" is equicontinuous at a point ""x"" ∈ ""X"" if for every ε > 0, there exists a  δ > 0 such that ""d""(""ƒ""(""x""), ""ƒ""(""x"")) < ε for all ""ƒ"" ∈ ""F"" and all ""x"" such that ""d""(""x"", ""x"") < δ. The family is pointwise equicontinuous if it is equicontinuous at each point of ""X"".          The family ""F"" is uniformly equicontinuous if for every ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that ""d""(""ƒ""(""x""), ""ƒ""(""x"")) < ε for all ""ƒ"" ∈ ""F"" and all ""x"", ""x"" ∈ ""X"" such that ""d""(""x"", ""x"") < δ.          For comparison, the statement 'all functions ""ƒ"" in ""F"" are continuous' means that for every ε > 0, every ""ƒ"" ∈ ""F"", and every ""x"" ∈ ""X"", there exists a δ > 0 such that ""d""(""ƒ""(""x""), ""ƒ""(""x"")) < ε for all ""x"" ∈ ""X"" such that ""d""(""x"", ""x"") < δ.          More generally, when ""X"" is a topological space, a set ""F"" of functions from ""X"" to ""Y"" is said to be equicontinuous at ""x"" if for every ε > 0, ""x"" has a neighborhood ""U"" such that          for all and ""ƒ"" ∈ ""F"". This definition usually appears in the context of topological vector spaces.          When ""X"" is compact, a set is uniformly equicontinuous if and only if it is equicontinuous at every point, for essentially the same reason as that uniform continuity and continuity coincide on compact spaces. Used on its own, the term ""equiconituity"" may refer to either the pointwise or uniform notion, depending on the context. On a compact space, these notions coincide.          Some basic properties follow immediately from the definition. Every finite set of continuous functions is equicontinuous. The closure of an equicontinuous set is again equicontinuous. Every member of a uniformly equicontinuous set of functions is uniformly continuous, and every finite set of uniformly continuous functions is uniformly equicontinuous.          Let ""X"" be a compact Hausdorff space, and equip ""C""(""X"") with the uniform norm, thus making ""C""(""X"") a Banach space, hence a metric space. Then Arzelà–Ascoli theorem states that a subset of ""C""(""X"") is compact if and only if it is closed, uniformly bounded and equicontinuous. This is analogous to the Heine-Borel theorem, which states that subsets of R are compact if and only if they are closed and bounded. As a corollary, every uniformly bounded equicontinuous sequence in ""C""(""X"") contains a subsequence that converges uniformly to a continuous function on ""X"".          In view of Arzelà–Ascoli theorem, a sequence in ""C""(""X"") converges uniformly if and only if it is equicontinuous and converges pointwise. The hypothesis of the statement can be weakened a bit: a sequence in ""C""(""X"") converges uniformly if it is equicontinuous and converges pointwise on a dense subset to some function on ""X"" (not assumed continuous). This weaker version is typically used to prove Arzelà–Ascoli theorem for separable compact spaces. Another consequence is that the limit of an equicontinuous pointwise convergent sequence of continuous functions on a metric space, or on a locally compact space, is continuous. (See below for an example.) In the above, the hypothesis of compactness of ""X""  cannot be relaxed. To see that, consider a compactly supported continuous function ""g"" on R with ""g""(0) = 1, and consider the equicontinuous sequence of functions on R defined by ""ƒ""(""x"") = . Then, ""ƒ"" converges pointwise to 0 but does not converge uniformly to 0.          This criterion for uniform convergence is often useful in real and complex analysis. Suppose we are given a sequence of continuous functions that converges pointwise on some open subset ""G"" of R. As noted above, it actually converges uniformly on a compact subset of ""G"" if it is equicontinuous on the compact set. In practice, showing the equicontinuity is often not so difficult. For example, if the sequence consists of differentiable functions or functions with some regularity (e.g., the functions are solutions of a differential equation), then the mean value theorem or some other kinds of estimates can be used to show the sequence is equicontinuous. It then follows that the limit of the sequence is continuous on every compact subset of ""G""; thus, continuous on ""G"". A similar argument can be made when the functions are holomorphic. One can use, for instance, Cauchy's estimate to show the equicontinuity (on a compact subset) and conclude that the limit is holomorphic. Note that the equicontinuity is essential here. For example, ""ƒ""(""x"") = converges to a multiple of the discontinuous sign function.          Let ""E"", ""F"" be Banach spaces, and Γ be a family of continuous linear operators from ""E"" into ""F"". Then Γ is equicontinuous if and only if          that is, Γ is uniformly bounded in operator norm. Also, by linearity, Γ is uniformly equicontinuous if and only if it is equicontinuous at 0.          The uniform boundedness principle (also known as the Banach–Steinhaus theorem) states that Γ is equicontinuous if it is pointwise bounded; i.e., for each . The result can be generalized to a case when F is locally convex and E is a barreled space.          Alaoglu's theorem states that if ""E"" is a topological vector space, then every equicontinuous subset of ""E*"" is weak-* relatively compact.          The most general scenario in which equicontinuity can be defined is for topological spaces whereas ""uniform"" equicontinuity requires the filter of neighbourhoods of one point to be somehow comparable with the filter of neighbourhood of another point. The latter is most generally done via a uniform structure, giving a uniform space. Appropriate definitions in these cases are as follows:          A weaker concept is that of even continuity:          For metric spaces, there are standard topologies and uniform structures derived from the metrics, and then these general definitions are equivalent to the metric-space definitions.          Stochastic equicontinuity is a version of equicontinuity used in the context of sequences of functions of random variables, and their convergence.","['Continuous mappings', 'Mathematical analysis']"
49536765,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49536765,Crazy Eyes (Filter album),"Crazy Eyes is the seventh studio album by American industrial rock band Filter. The album was released on April 8, 2016. The first single, ""Take Me to Heaven"", was released in January 2016. In its opening week, the album debuted at number 151 on the Billboard 200 charts, the band's lowest debut to date.          Similar to several other Filter albums, prior to recording, the band received an entire lineup change besides frontman and band founder Richard Patrick. New members recruited included guitarist Oumi Kapila, bassist Ashley Dzerigian, drummer Chris Reeve and keyboardist Bobby Miller.          The album marked a change in sound from prior Filter albums, moving into a direction Patrick coined as ""new industrial"". He described it as ""...more experimental and crazy...scary, weird places instead of doing that big-ass guitar sound again."" ""Billboard"" described it as ""...hardly bereft of guitars but there are a substantial amount of electronics and effects in use. The result features heavy industrial crunch and solemn, ambient songs that reach back to Patrick’s time in Nine Inch Nails and the first Filter album, 1995’s ""Short Bus"".          Thematically, the album still keeps with the band's themes of frustration and anger. Additionally, Patrick described it as an attempt ""to look at people's unexplainable behavior and assess it, using sound. It's a way to approximate the insanity of the human condition."" The track ""Take Me to Heaven"" was written by Patrick's struggle with dealing with the death of his father. Patrick recalled: I was looking into the eyes of my father when he was passing away, and I held his hand...He glanced at me really quickly, focused on me, had this look of gratitude, and then he slipped away. I was almost like, 'I hope you're going to heaven'. Scientifically, the idea doesn't make any sense to me, but if there is a heaven, take me there.          The track ""Nothing in My Hands"" was written about the Ferguson and Michael Brown shootings.          The album's first single, ""Take Me to Heaven"", was first premiered on the ""Billboard"" website in January 2016. The album is scheduled for release on April 8, 2016, through Wind-Up Records. Two days before release, ""Billboard"" put up the entire album for streaming. 'Crazy Eyes' debuted at #151 on the Billboard 200, selling 5,000 copies in its first week.          The album was generally well received. Allmusic praised the album for being something new while still being familiar to Patrick's past with Filter and Nine Inch Nails, describing it as ""Less politically on the nose than the poppy ""Anthems for the Damned"", more mature than the easy retread of ""The Trouble with Angels"", and more visceral than ""The Sun Comes Out Tonight"" and ultimately that ""Crazy Eyes"" manages to tread new ground for Filter while respectfully acknowledging the sound that propelled the band in the first place. The Sputnik Music staff review echoes these sentiments, stating that the album was better than Filter's last few albums, but that ""though harder to digest on a first listen, these songs gradually get under your skin, revealing one of Filter’s greatest LPs to date."" Renowned for Sound was less positive about the album, criticizing Patrick's rough vocals and concluding that ""Patrick tries to cover too much ground on one record, creating the feeling of a collection of songs instead of the feeling of an album. Had ""Crazy Eyes"" featured a unity of purpose, the great songs on the record could have been extended to making a great album.

Samuelson, were married in 1936 and had two children.          Samuelson served in the U.S. Navy during World War II as a weapons instructor and gunsmith at the Farragut Naval Training Station, a major inland training facility at Lake Pend Oreille in northern Idaho.          After the war, Samuelson stayed in the area; he brought his family out from Illinois and opened a sporting goods store in nearby Sandpoint. He also had an interest in a business that sold and leased mining and logging equipment.          A conservative, Samuelson was encouraged to run for the state in 1960 by Governor Robert Smylie. Samuelson won and was re-elected in 1962 and 1964. After the Democratic landslide of 1964, he decided to run for governor in 1966, which was still held by three-term incumbent Smylie, a moderate Republican from Boise and former state attorney general. In a heated race that drew national attention to the Republican gubernatorial primary, Samuelson won handily, 61 to 39%.

The pilot of the twin-engine Piper PA-23 was the only survivor. Occurring only seven weeks before the election, the Democrats nominated the runner-up in the primary, state senator Cecil Andrus of Orofino, whom Samuelson defeated by over 10,000 votes. During the 1970 gubernatorial campaign, Samuelson supported molybdenum mining in central Idaho's White Cloud Mountains, and was defeated for re-election by Andrus – a staunch opponent of the mining development – and returned to private life.

A few facilities from this period still remain on the temple grounds, including a cistern and iron pot for serving food and water to thousands of monks.           It continued to play an important role in subsequent centuries, but shrank as the state's support for Buddhism disappeared under the Joseon Dynasty. Joseon Dynasty founder Taejo is said to have retired to a spot near Beopjusa after tiring of his sons' fighting.          Beopjusa Temple owns a number of cultural heritage items: 3 national treasures; 12 miscellaneous treasures; 21 items of tangible cultural heritage of Chungcheongbukdo; and 1 item of cultural heritage material. In addition, the temple itself is designated Historic Site No. 503, the region Scenic Site No. 61, and it is also home to two natural monuments.           Among its cultural heritage possessions, one is truly unique. It is the only wooden pagoda in Korea that has preserved its original appearance, named Palsangjeon (National Treasure No. 55). Originally there were two such structures in Korea, but when the Main Buddha Hall at Ssangbongsa Temple burnt down in 1984, Palsangjeon became the only surviving wooden pagoda designated a cultural heritage. In a hall open on four sides, the Huigyeon Bosal (The Beautiful Bodhisattva, Sudarsana) (Treasure No. 1417) is enshrined. This bodhisattva stands on a foundation stone and carries an incense burner on his head to fulfill his vow to offer incense to the Buddha for eternity.          The Folding Screen of Celestial Charts (Treasure No. 848) is a cultural heritage not directly related to Buddhism. Featuring 300 constellations consisting of 3,083 stars, the Charts were created by Kim Tae-seo and An Guk-bin, two scholars from the Meteorological Administration. They are based on charts their teacher, I. Koegler, made in 1723 during his stay in China. Of all the celestial charts made by Koegler, this one is the largest and most accurate, thus giving it international value as well. It is thought that these charts were given to Beopjusa Temple by King Yeongjo when the Wondang (Prayer Shrine) for the king’s deceased Royal Concubine Yeongbin of the Yi Clan was established here.           Another unusual heritage is the stele of Ven. Jajeong Gukjon (慈淨國尊: 1240-1327) (Tangible Cultural Heritage of Chungcheongbukdo No. 79). A memorial to this monk who had risen to the rank of National Preceptor was inscribed on the natural stone cliff by royal decree of King Chunghye. Seonhuigung Wondang, a structure located behind the Main Buddha Hall, is the prayer shrine for Yeongbin of the Yi Clan, the mother of Crown Prince Sado and a royal concubine of King Yeongjo. Having the same name as her shrine in the Chilgung Shrine Complex (where ancestral tablets of seven royal concubines are kept), it is unusual a prayer shrine for a royal concubine be located in a temple.           Another cultural heritage relic to see is the Stone Pot, Tangible Cultural Heritage of Chungcheongbuk-do No. 204. A stone sculpture in the shape of an earthen pot, it is partially buried in the ground at a site 40 meters (131 feet) left of Chongji Seon Center. Cultural heritage experts have no idea about its purpose, but legend says it was used to store kimchi.           Beopjusa was chosen by Bruce Lee as the original setting for the movie ""Game of Death"", with the five floors of Palsangjeon pagoda representing five different martial arts. Since Bruce Lee died before the movie was completed, the screenplay was changed, and Beopjusa was edited out.          It also offers temple stay programs where visitors can experience Buddhist culture.","['Buddhist temples in South Korea', 'Boeun County', 'Buddhist temples of the Jogye Order', 'Buildings and structures in North Chungcheong Province', '653 establishments', 'Religious organizations established in the 7th century', 'Visitor attractions in North Chungcheong Province']"
5392262,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5392262,Shabaka Stone,"The Shabaka Stone, sometimes Shabaqo, is a relic from the Nubian Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt incised with an Egyptian religious text. It is a composition of breccia measuring 91 cm on the left in height and 95 cm on the right as well as 137 cm in width. The text claims to contain the surviving content of a worm-ridden, decaying papyrus that was found as pharaoh Shabaka was inspecting the temple of Ptah in Memphis, Egypt. In later years, the stone is believed to have been used as a millstone damaging the hieroglyphics. This damage is accompanied by other intentional defacements, leaving the hieroglyphics in poor condition.          It was once placed within the Temple of Ptah in Memphis in the 8th century BCE. It was removed at an unknown date. In 1805, the stone was a donation by George John, 2nd earl of Spencer, to the British Museum where it has been located since. It is known that prior to coming to England it was in Alexandria, but how it got there or when is unknown.          Since this stone was meant to be a preservation of an older text, the question regarding the dating of the original work has been sought after. Attempts to attribute a definite date for the original text have been inconclusive. Some scholars claimed it originated in the Old Kingdom while others said it went further back. Today, scholars feel it is clear that it cannot predate the Nineteenth Dynasty.          The text includes two main divisions with a short introduction and an ending summary. The first division relates the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt. Ptah works through Horus to accomplish this unification. The other is a creation story that establishes Ptah as the creator of all things, including gods.           Ptah also centers in all things such as the heart and tongue of his creations, and thus, in a sense, making him the center of existence. The manner of creation came by Ptah's thoughts in his heart that were then uttered by his tongue. This creation story is sometimes referred to as a Memphite Theology.

4982245,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4982245,Degen's eight-square identity,"In mathematics, Degen's eight-square identity establishes that the product of two numbers, each of which being a sum of eight squares, is itself the sum of eight squares.          Namely:          First discovered by around 1818, the identity was independently rediscovered by John Thomas Graves (1843) and Arthur Cayley (1845). The latter two derived it while working on an extension of quaternions called octonions. In algebraic terms the identity means that the norm of product of two octonions equals the product of their norms: formula_10. Similar statements are true for quaternions (Euler's four-square identity), complex numbers (the Brahmagupta–Fibonacci two-square identity) and real numbers. In 1898 Adolf Hurwitz proved that there is no similar bilinear identity for 16 squares (sedenions) or any other number of squares except for 1,2,4, and 8. However, in the 1960s, H. Zassenhaus, W. Eichhorn, and A. Pfister (independently) showed there can be a non-bilinear identity for 16 squares.           Note that each quadrant reduces to a version of Euler's four-square identity:          and similarly for the other three quadrants. By Pfister's theorem, a different sort of eight-square identity can be given where the formula_16, introduced below, are non-bilinear and merely rational functions of the formula_17. Thus,          where,          and,          with,          Incidentally, the formula_32 obey the identity,","['Analytic number theory', 'Mathematical identities']"

31575682,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31575682,Jason Stearns,"Jason K. Stearns is an American writer who worked for ten years in the Congo, including three years during the Second Congo War. He first traveled to the Congo in 2001 to work for a local human rights organization, Héritiers de la Justice, in Bukavu. He went on to work for the United Nations peacekeeping mission (MONUC). In 2008 Stearns was named by the UN Secretary General to lead a special UN investigation into the violence in the country.          Stearns is the author of the book, """", and the blog, ""Congo Siasa"". He received a Ph.D. in political science from Yale University on May 24, 2016.          Jason Stearns was born in San Francisco in 1976 to Stephen C. Stearns, an evolutionary biologist, and Beverly Peterson Stearns, a journalist. He has an older brother, Justin, who is professor of Middle Eastern history at New York University.          At the age of six, the family moved to Switzerland, where Stephen Stearns taught biology at the University of Basel. Stearns attended Swiss public school in Arlesheim and Muenchenstein, on the outskirts of Basel, and spent a year in Laja, Chile, on an exchange program. Upon graduation from Gymnasium Muenchenstein, he volunteered at the Swiss Tropical Institute's field research station in Ifakara, Tanzania.          In 1997, Jason joined his older brother in the United States, attending first Hampshire College and then neighboring Amherst College in Massachusetts. He graduated with a degree in political science. Having been accepted to law school at Harvard Law School, he traveled to Bukavu in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo to volunteer with Héritiers de la Justice, a local human rights group in September 2001. Deferring law school, he went on to work for the International Human Rights Law Group and the United Nations peacekeeping operation MONUC for the following two years. He eventually decided not to attend law school, enrolling in a PhD program in political science at Yale University in 2009.          Between 2005 and 2007, Stearns was based in Nairobi, Kenya, as a senior analyst for the International Crisis Group, working on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi. In 2007, he left to spend a year and a half researching and writing Dancing in the Glory of Monsters, a history of the Congo wars of 1996-2003, based on interviews with leading protagonists of the conflict. The title stems from a speech given by Congolese President Laurent Kabila in which he castigates Congolese for blaming their woes on a few political leaders, suggesting that the political malaise in the country is a more systemic problem. The book, which was eventually published in 2011, received critical acclaim in major newspapers and magazines.          In 2008, Stearns was named as coordinator of the United Nations Group of Experts on the Congo, a panel responsible for researching support and financing of armed groups in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. In their final report, the Group found both the Rwandan and Congolese governments guilty of violating United Nations sanctions. According to eyewitness testimony, phone records and other documentary evidence, the Rwandan government had provided military support to the National Congress for the Defense of the People (CNDP) rebel group, while the Congolese government had collaborated with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) rebels, as well as other Congolese armed groups.          Following the report, the Swedish and Dutch government temporarily suspended aid to the Rwandan government. Several months after the publication of the report, the Rwandan government arrested the leader of the CNDP, Laurent Nkunda, and struck a peace deal with the Congolese government.          In 2010, Stearns married Lusungu Kayani, a Tanzanian-American employee of the United Nations and a fashion and textile entrepreneur.

685527,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=685527,San Joaquin (train),"The San Joaquin (sometimes referred to as San Joaquins) is a passenger train operated by Amtrak, with funding from the California Department of Transportation as part of the Amtrak California network in California's Central Valley. Fourteen trains a day run between its southern terminus at Bakersfield and Stockton, where the route splits to Oakland (five trains each way per day) or Sacramento (two trains each way per day). At Bakersfield, Thruway Motorcoach service offers connections to the ""Pacific Surfliner"" at Los Angeles Union Station, several points in Southern California, the High Desert and the Central Coast. At Emeryville, Thruway Motorcoach service offers connections to San Francisco.          The ""San Joaquin"" is Amtrak's fifth-busiest service and the railroad's third-busiest in California. During fiscal year 2013 (FY2013), the service carried a record 1.2 million passengers, a 6.6% increase from FY2012. Total revenue during FY2013 was , a 1.9% increase over FY2012.          On July 1, 2015, management and governance of the San Joaquins passed to the San Joaquin Joint Powers Authority.          The ""San Joaquin"" runs over lines that once hosted several passenger trains a day. The top trains were the ""Golden Gate"" on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (predecessor to BNSF), and the ""San Joaquin Daylight"" on the Southern Pacific Railroad (later acquired by Union Pacific). Prior to 1960s service cutbacks passenger service continued south of Bakersfield, to Glendale and Los Angeles.          In April 1965 as ridership on passenger trains continued to drop, the Santa Fe Railway received permission from the Interstate Commerce Commission to severely curtail ""Golden Gate"" operations, with service finally abandoned three years later. The ""San Joaquin Daylight"" was discontinued with the start-up of Amtrak in May 1971.          Other passenger trains that ran through the Central Valley included Southern Pacific's ""Owl"" and Santa Fe's ""San Francisco Chief"" and ""Valley Flyer"".          Amtrak routed all Los Angeles-San Francisco service over the Southern Pacific's Coast Line in its initial 1971 route structure, leaving the San Joaquin Valley without service. Both the Southern Pacific (""San Joaquin Daylight"") and the Santa Fe (""San Francisco Chief"") had served the region. Beginning in 1972 Amtrak revisited the decision at the urging of area congressmen, notably Bernice F. Sisk, who favored service between Oakland and Barstow or, failing that, Barstow and Sacramento. Service began on March 5, 1974 with one round-trip per day between Bakersfield and Oakland and a bus connection from Bakersfield to Los Angeles. Amtrak chose the Santa Fe route over the Southern Pacific, citing the higher speed ( vs. ) of the Santa Fe and freight congestion on the Southern Pacific. The decision was not without controversy, with Sisk alleging that the Southern Pacific lobbied the Nixon Administration to influence the decision.          In 1979 Amtrak proposed discontinuing the ""San Joaquin"" as part of system-wide reductions ordered by the Carter Administration. The state of California stepped in to provide a yearly subsidy (then $700,000) to cover the train's operating losses, and it was retained. At the time the state asked Amtrak to add a second daily frequency between Oakland and Bakersfield, and to extend the service south over the Tehachapi Pass to Los Angeles. Amtrak added the second train in February 1980, but attempts to extend the train over the Tehachapi Loop failed due to Southern Pacific's opposition.          To this day the ""San Joaquin"" does not continue south of Bakersfield because the only line between Bakersfield and points south, the Tehachapi Pass, is one of the world's busiest single-track freight rail lines.          Over the past 30 years service has increased from just one round trip per day to four round trips to Oakland, plus two round trips to Sacramento.          For its first two years of operation the ""San Joaquin"" used single-level coaches Amtrak had inherited from other railroads. In October 1976 Amtrak ""Amfleeted"" the ""San Joaquin"", introducing new Amfleet coaches to the service. From 1987-1989 Amtrak used Superliner and ex-ATSF Hi-Level coaches. For a short period beginning on June 15, 1987, this included a full dining car on one of the trains. Amtrak requipped the ""San Joaquin"" trains again in 1989, this time with new Horizon coaches, when service expanded to three daily round-trips. The ""San Joaquin"" began receiving the Superliner-derived ""California Cars"" that it uses today in 1995.          Amtrak California operates its own fleet of EMD F59PHI and GE P32-8WH locomotives that are used on ""San Joaquin"" trains. These locomotives are owned by Caltrans and carry its CDTX reporting marks. Amtrak owned locomotives are also occasionally used on the ""San Joaquin"", including the P42DC.          The ""San Joaquin"" is equipped with Amtrak California's fleet of ""California Car"" bi-level, high-capacity passenger cars owned by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). Each trainset typically consists of two coach cars, a coach/baggage car, a café (dining) car, and a cab/coach car. The cab/coach car is a similar to other coaches but with an engineer's operating cab and headlights on one end, allowing the train to be operated in push-pull mode, which eliminates the need to turn the train at each end-point. Caltrans is in the process of refitting the cab/coach cars to have a space on car's lower level for storage for checked luggage and bikes.          Caltrans also owns several Surfliner bi-level cars that are used on some San Joaquin trainsets. The newer cars look very similar to the California Car fleet, but feature reclining seats, open overhead luggage racks and a restroom on the upper-level of each car.          In 2007 Caltrans paid to repair several wreck-damaged Superliner I coaches in exchange for a six-year lease of the Amtrak owned cars that are normally used on long-distance trains. 4 of these cars are painted to match the ""California car"" livery and often appear in service on the ""San Joaquin"" route in place of a coach/baggage car.          Increasing ridership on the ""San Joaquin"" led Caltrans to purchase 14 Comet IB rail cars from New Jersey Transit in 2008 for $75,000 per car. The former commuter cars refurbished and reconfigured by Amtrak's Beech Grove Shops to serve as intercity coaches at a cost of approximately $20 million. The refurbished cars have reclining inter-city seats with tray tables (4 per row), AmtrakConnect WiFi, two power outlets at each seat pair, luggage racks, trash/recycling bins, a restroom, and 6 workstation tables in the center of the car.          Caltrans has also paid to lease and refurbish 3 Non-Powered Control Units (F40PH locomotives converted into cab/baggage cars) and 3 Horizon Dinettes to serve as café cars (using the same equipment as other Amtrak California trains).          These single-level cars will be used to create two ""Comet car"" trainsets that will run between Oakland and Bakersfield. That will allow Caltrans to break up two bi-level ""California car"" trainsets to use the cars to add another coach car to each of the San Joaquin's remaining ""California Car"" trainsets.          Caltrans had planned to use the ""Comet car"" trainsets on trains starting in July 2013, but the refurbishing process took longer than expected. The first ""Comet car"" trainset was put into regular service on October 21, 2013 and the second trainset was put into regular service on April 15, 2014.          The ""San Joaquin"" runs from Bakersfield's Truxtun Avenue Station northward on BNSF Railway's Mojave Subdivision within Bakersfield, the Bakersfield Subdivision from Bakersfield to Calwa (Fresno), then on the Stockton Subdivision from Calwa to Stockton.          At Stockton the routes split to Oakland or Sacramento:","['Public transportation in the San Joaquin Valley Area', 'Public transportation in Kings County, California', 'Public transportation in Fresno County, California', 'Public transportation in Madera County, California', 'Public transportation in Merced County, California', 'Public transportation in Stanislaus County, California', 'Public transportation in San Joaquin County, California', 'Public transportation in Sacramento County, California', 'Public transportation in Contra Costa County, California', 'Public transportation in Alameda County, California', 'Public transportation in Los Angeles County, California', 'Public transportation in Southern California', 'San Joaquin Valley', 'Amtrak routes', 'Passenger rail transportation in California', 'Transportation in Kern County, California']"

Trained at the Kingston Art School, then did his military service in the Seaforth Highlanders in Malaysia ( during the Malayan Emergency). He then graduated from The Royal College of Art , London UK, in 1955. After graduating he wrote to John Fowler ( Colefax & Fowler), writing "" You are the only person in the world I want to work for"". Unfortunately, his interview with John Fowler didn't go as well as one might hope. John Fowler said to him "" What ""have"" you been doing at that college for three years? You know nothing!"".Luckily, three weeks later, Imogene Taylor of Colefax & Fowler called to offer him a position. His first celebrity job was an apartment in Eaton Square for Sir Laurence Olivier and Vivian Leigh, as well as working on their country house. After a couple of years or working with John Fowler and Nancy Lancaster, he realized that he was never going to climb any higher at Colefax & Fowler, luckily Mrs. Henry ""Sister Parish"" II was in London.          John Fowler "" lent"" Keith out to Sister Parish for job in Johannesburg, who, when the job was finished, offered Keith a job in New York and $40.00 a week. So in 1957 he left England for the Big Apple, with $38.00 in his pocket. The next morning he took a cab straight from the boat to the Sutton Place home address of Sister Parish- who had forgotten that she had hired him. On the first day in the office he was handed a card that read "" Lord help the Mister who comes between you and Sister"", things went downhill from there. Keith did not like Sister Parish, and not only because he wasn't allowed to use the bathroom ( it was all women in the office), and had to go across the street to the Old Westbury Hotel, instead. He was not impressed by Sister Parish's decorating, which he said was "" appealing on the surface but without depth"". He managed to deal with the situation for nine months before he informed Sister Parish that he was leaving to start his own firm. On hearing this news Sister Parish said to him "" you will never last for a year. You don't ""know"" anyone."".          When Keith first arrived in New York he had searched for an apartment share in the New York Times, and ended up meeting Robin Roberts . Before things could really settle Keith had a partner and firm, Roberts & Irvine . Finding it difficult to find the French and English fabrics that where a staple in Keith Irvine's decorating style, Roberts and Irvine created the fabric house Clarence House. Tom Fleming became an assistant as the business took off. Before the year was out the firm split ( Keith claimed that with the influx of ""top drawer"" clients, Roberts had become a ""liability"" as he didn't ""move readily in ""polite society""', Roberts took Clarence House, and Keith left to start Keith Irvine & Co.

10447257,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10447257,Bliaut,"The bliaut or bliaud is a women's and also a men's overgarment worn from the eleventh to the thirteenth century in Western Europe, featuring voluminous skirts and horizontal puckering or pleating across a snugly fitted under bust abdomen. The sleeves are the most immediately notable difference when comparing the bliaut to other female outer clothing of the Middle Ages. They fit closely from the shoulder to approximately the elbow, and then widen from the elbow to drape to floor- or nearly floor-length. This garment's usage appears to be geographically limited to areas of French influence, with some works depicting the garment or the garment in transition as far away as Rome and modern Germany.          Examples of this garment and its evolution appear as early as the Bayeaux Tapestry, wherein a female figure wears a garment which is loose in the body, but has the extended sleeve that would be an identifying characteristic of the style after its transition. Later examples of statuary such as the jambs of the Cathedral of Chartres west façade portals show the full accomplishment of the bliaut on female saints and patrons, such as the ""Lady With Embroidered Hem,"" appearing on the left, beside the left portal Paintings and illuminated items that depict the item as well include a miniature called Ladder of Virtue dated to the twelfth century and the work of Claricia, a nun and illuminator who appears to be wearing one in her small self-portrait in a South German Psalter dated c. 1200, currently in the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore.          The fabrics available in this time would have been limited to woolens, linens, and silks. A fine wool or silk seems to be the best option, as linen is rather more difficult to dye a permanent color, and colored depictions of this item show a great deal of color.          The historic costuming community remains divided over the method by which the abdominal folds are achieved. Theories range from cut to lacing to fabric manipulation methods.          The achievement of skirt volume is also debated, ranging from a hipline seam with attached wide skirt to the addition of gores/godets to expand the hemline.          The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood became interested in the ideals and clothing of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. As a result, the bliaut as then understood is frequently featured upon women in their works. The most popular example of this particular garment in Pre-Raphaelite art may be by Edmund Blair Leighton.","['Medieval costume', '12th century in Europe', 'French clothing']"
18934980,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18934980,Rick Alan Ross,"Rick Alan Ross (born 1952) is an American deprogrammer, cult specialist, and author. Ross has intervened in more than 350 deprogramming cases in various countries.          Ross faced charges of unlawful imprisonment over a 1991 forcible deprogramming of United Pentecostal Church International member Jason Scott; a jury acquitted him at trial. In 1995, a civil lawsuit filed by Scott resulted in a multimillion-dollar judgement against Ross and his co-defendants. Later, Ross and Scott reached a settlement in which Ross agreed to pay Scott 5,000 and provide 200 hours of professional services at no charge.          Ross was the only deprogrammer to work with members of the religious group Branch Davidian prior to the Waco siege; some scholars later criticized his involvement with the siege.          Rick Alan Ross was born in 1952 in Cleveland, Ohio, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona in 1956. His mother worked for the Jewish Community Center and his father was a plumber. He was raised and went to school in Arizona with the exception of one year that he was sent to the Camden Military Academy in South Carolina after skipping too much school during high school. He graduated from Phoenix Union High School in 1971.           After high school, Ross worked for two years at a finance company and at a bank, but then got into legal trouble in his early 20s during a time period that he was in between jobs. In 1974, he pleaded guilty to trespassing after being charged for the attempted burglary of a vacant model home with a friend, and was sentenced to probation. In 1975, he was charged with grand theft, again with a friend, for embezzling from a jewelry shop where the friend worked. He returned everything, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 4 more years of probation, which was terminated early. While he was on probation, he worked for a cousin's car salvage business. During an interview with the ""New York Daily News"" in 2004, Ross said, ""I was young and foolish and made mistakes that I deeply regret. I did whatever the court required, completed my probation in 1979, and the guilty verdicts were vacated in 1983. I have gone on with my life and never again got in that kind of trouble.""          Ross became concerned about extremist organizations in 1982 when he learned that a fringe religious group had encouraged missionaries to become employees at his grandmother's nursing home where they were targeting elderly residents for conversion to Messianic Judaism. According to Ross, the missionaries were threatening Jewish residents, many of whom had survived persecution in Europe, that they'd burn in hell if they didn't convert. Outraged, Ross brought this to the attention of the home's director and of the local Jewish community and campaigned to have the group's activities stopped.          Following the incident at his grandmother's nursing home, Ross continued his involvement in the organized Jewish community and worked with the Jewish Federation of Greater Phoenix to write a brochure on the cult phenomenon in Arizona. This led the Union for Reform Judaism to appoint Ross to two national committees focused on cults and inter-religious affairs and he also volunteered as a lecturer and researcher for the denomination.          In 1983, Ross started working for Jewish Family and Children's Services (JFCS) in Phoenix as the coordinator for the Jewish Prisoners Program, which he founded. His work in the prison system covered social services for Jewish inmates, advocating for their religious rights, and providing education regarding hate groups. In addition, he chaired the Coalition of Jewish Prisoners Programs, the umbrella organization for an international group of human services agencies providing assistance to Jewish inmates and their families. He also served on the religious advisory committee for the Arizona Department of Corrections and was later elected as its chairman. From his work in the prison system, Ross discovered that prisoners were a prime target for cult groups and through his role on the religious advisory committee, he helped develop a policy on proselytizing to inmates. He also worked for Phoenix Bureau of Jewish Education, designing a curriculum and teaching about destructive cults.          In 1986 Ross left JFCS to become a full-time private consultant and deprogrammer, In this capacity, he worked with the Cult Awareness Network (CAN).          In 1989 the CBS television program ""48 Hours"" covered Ross's deprogramming of a 14-year-old boy, Aaron Paron, a member of the Potter's House Christian Fellowship. According to his mother, when she distanced herself from the church, Aaron began viewing her as ""possessed by the devil""; he became suicidal and ran away from home, refusing to leave the organization. Aaron's mother had made multiple calls to the police and, prior to filming, Potter's House entered into an agreement that they would not have contact with or harbor the minor, entice him away from his mother, attempt to influence his behavior, or take any action that would interfere with his mother's parental rights. The program focused on Ross's efforts to persuade the boy to view Potter's House as ""a destructive Bible-based group"" which took control of its members' lives. According to a review in ""The New York Times"", the 48-hour intervention apparently persuaded Aaron that his mother was not possessed by the Devil and that Potter's House was not what it seemed. In a closing scene filmed three weeks later, Aaron's psychologist assured his mother that Aaron was ""back in the land of the living now"".          In 1987, Ross deprogrammed two former members of the Branch Davidian group in upstate New York, and in 1988 began receiving calls about the Davidian group led by David Koresh in Waco, Texas. Ross was the only deprogrammer to work with Branch Davidian members prior to the 1993 siege at Waco. The CBS television network hired Ross as an on-scene analyst for their coverage of the Waco siege and he was consulted by the FBI as well.           Criticism of government agencies' involvement with Ross has come from Nancy Ammerman, a professor of sociology of religion, who cited FBI interview notes which stated Ross ""has a personal hatred for all religious cults"". She further stated the BATF and the FBI did rely on Ross when he recommended that agents ""attempt to publicly humiliate Koresh, hoping to drive a wedge between him and his followers"". Other scholars of religion also criticized Ross' involvement.          Ross faced unlawful imprisonment charges over a 1991 forcible deprogramming of United Pentecostal Church International member Jason Scott, whose mother was referred to Ross by the CAN. Ross was acquitted of these charges by the jury at trial.          Scott later filed a civil suit against Ross, two of his associates and CAN in federal court. In September 1995, a nine-member jury unanimously held the defendants liable for conspiracy to deprive Scott of his civil rights and religious liberties. In addition, the jury held that Ross and his associates (but not CAN) ""intentionally or recklessly acted in a way so outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency and to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community."" The case resulted in an award of 875,000 in compensatory damages and punitive damages in the amount of 5,000,000 against Ross, 1,000,000 against CAN, and 250,000 against each of Ross's two other co-defendants. The case bankrupted the CAN, and a coalition of groups that were attacked by the CAN bought its assets, and ran a new version of the CAN which become active in religious freedom causes. According to Eugene Gallagher, the Scott case marked a watershed for non-traditional religions in North America.          Scott later reconciled with his mother, who had originally hired Ross to deprogram him. Scott terminated his lawyer, Kendrick Moxon, a prominent Scientologist attorney, and was persuaded by his mother to settle with Ross. Under the terms of the settlement, the two agreed that Ross would pay Scott 5,000 and provide 200 hours of his professional services.          According to the book ""American Countercultures"", Ross and others forwarded the notion that charismatic leaders were able to brainwash college-aged youths, and that such cases were in need of forcible removal from the cult environment and deprogramming. In a book that Ross self-published in 2014, he wrote that after the Scott case he stopped involuntary deprogramming work with adults, advising against such interventions with adults because of the risk of legal consequences.          Ross started a website with his archives in 1996. Launched under the name ""Rick A. Ross Institute for the Study of Destructive Cults, Controversial Groups, and Movements"", it displayed material on controversial groups and movements and their leaders, including Charles Manson, Jim Jones, David Koresh, as well as the Westboro Baptist Church on which Ross had been collecting data since 1993. Content from the website and Ross' opinion surrounding it has been cited in books such as Andrew Breitbart and Mark Ebner's ""Hollywood, Interrupted"" in which Ross is quoted as forwarding the notion that Hollywood and the entertainment industry is rife with connections to controversial groups, and that celebrities as role models may influence people by their endorsement of such groups. According to Ann E. Robertson the Institute ""is an unusual source of considerable information about rather obscure groups"".          In April 2004 NXIVM sued unsuccessfully against the Institute in ""NXIVM Corp. v. Ross Institute"", claiming copyright infringement. In June 2004 Landmark Education filed a 1 million lawsuit against the Institute, alleging that the Institute's online archives damaged Landmark Education's product. In December 2005, Landmark Education filed to dismiss its own lawsuit with prejudice, purportedly on the grounds of a material change in case law after the publication of an opinion in another case, ""Donato v. Moldow"", regarding the Communications Decency Act of 1996.          The website was renamed in 2013 as the ""Cult Education Institute for the Study of Destructive Cults, Controversial Groups and Movements"", published under an educational nonprofit corporation of the same name.          By 2004, Ross had handled more than 350 deprogramming cases in various countries and testified as an expert witness in several court cases. He has also contributed to a number of books, including a foreword to Tim Madigan's ""See no Evil"" and a chapter to Roman Espejo's ""Cults: Opposing Viewpoints"".          In 2014 Ross self-published the book ""Cults Inside Out"". The book was published in China in 2015 by a Hong Kong publisher. It was also translated into Italian and published in Italy.","['1952 births', 'Living people', 'People from Cleveland, Ohio', 'American adoptees', 'American religious writers', 'Exit counselors', 'Critics of Falun Gong', 'Anti-cult organizations and individuals', 'Deprogrammers']"

49350587,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49350587,Chamba Rumal,"The Chamba Rumal or Chamba handkerchief is an embroidered handicraft that was once promoted under the patronage of the former rulers of Chamba kingdom. It is a common item of gift during marriages with detailed patterns in bright and pleasing colour schemes.          This product has been registered for protection under the Geographical indication of the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement. On 22 January 2007, it was listed as ""Chamba Rumal"" under the GI Act 1999 of the Government of India with registration confirmed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks under Classes 24 as Textile and Textile Goods, vide application number 79.          Earliest reported form of this rumal is the one made by Bebe Nanki, sister of Guru Nanak in the 16th century, which is now preserved in the Gurudwara at Hoshiarpur. The Victoria Albert Museum, London has a rumal which was gifted to the British in 1883 by Raja Gopal Singh and it has an embroidered scene of the Kurukshetra War of the epic Mahabharta. However, from the 17th century the women of the erstwhile princely state of Chamba (now part of Himachal Pradesh), including members of the royal family, indulged in embroidery of the rumals or handkerchiefs as a part of a marriage gifts or dowry to their daughters.          The handkerchiefs were made in geometrical shapes of square and rectangle using very fine hand made silk which was obtained from the Punjab or muslin cloth, a product of Bengal. Women created highly ornamental patterns using untwined thread made of silk produced in Sialkot (in Pakistan), Amritsar and Ludhiana. The embroidery technique adopted, called the ""dohara tanka"" or double satin stitch, created distinct identical patters on both faces of the fabric, which were attractive when viewed even from distance of 10 ft and more. The ""dohara tanka"" method is a heritage of Kashmir, which was adopted in Basohli and Chamba, but was improved upon by adopting themes from the special Mughal art of Chamba miniature paintings; this art form flourished during the 18th and 19th centuries. Following the downfall of the Mughal empire many expert artists of this craft migrated to the hill region of Himachal Pradesh. Raja Umed Singh of Chamba (1748–68) patronized the artists. These artists drew the outlines of the design on the fabric to be embroidered using fine charcoal and also suggested suitable colours to be adopted on the mythological themes of Krishna's raas-leela of the epic Mahabharata, and themes from Ramayana or scenes of marriage and game hunting to be embroidered; themes also included events from Gita Govinda, Bhagvat purana or only Radha-Krishna and Shiva-Parvati. Inspiration was also provided from the frescoes done in the Rang Mahal of Chamba. The women then executed the embroidery. In early 19th century, when Maharaja Ranjit Singh ruled over the Punjab Hill States, Sikh style of painting also influenced the Chamba Rumal.          Following Indian Independence, this art work lost its royal patronage, and quality deteriorated due to commercialization by making many cheaper varieties such as table cloths, cushion covers, clothing, and even various machine made items to compete in the market with cheaper similar work from other regions.          To revive this art work, in the later part of 1970s, at the initiative of Usha Bhagat (a friend of Indira Gandhi), the DCC located the original designs of this art work from museums and collections, and women artists were then trained in this art work. As a result 16 designs have been recreated and quality restored.          Known as a ""needle wonder"" Chamba Rumal is now made in square and rectangular shapes. The materials used still consist of muslin, malmal, khaddar (a coarse fabric), fine charcoal or brush, and silk threads without knots. Using a double satin stitch for the embroidery, both faces of the cloth are concurrently stitched by a forward and backward technique to maintain uniformity of design on both faces of the rumal.

5731748,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5731748,Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy,"Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a psychological therapy designed to aid in preventing the relapse of depression, specifically in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). Its intent to address MDD specifically distinguishes MBCT from other mindfulness-based therapies such as mindfulness-based stress reduction which is applicable to a broad range of disorders, and mindfulness-based relapse prevention which is used to treat addiction.          MBCT uses traditional cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) methods and adds in newer psychological strategies such as mindfulness and mindfulness meditation. Cognitive methods can include educating the participant about depression. Mindfulness and mindfulness meditation, focus on becoming aware of all incoming thoughts and feelings and accepting them, but not attaching or reacting to them. This process is known as ""Decentering"" and aids in disengaging from self-criticism, rumination, and dysphoric mood that can arise when reacting to negative thinking patterns.          Like CBT, MBCT functions on the theory that when individuals who have historically had depression become distressed, they return to automatic cognitive processes that can trigger a depressive episode. The goal of MBCT is to interrupt these automatic processes and teach the participants to focus less on reacting to incoming stimuli, and instead accepting and observing them without judgment. This mindfulness practice allows the participant to notice when automatic processes are occurring and to alter their reaction to be more of a reflection. It is theorized that this aspect of MBCT is responsible for the observed clinical outcomes.          Beyond its use in reducing depressive acuity, research additionally supports the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation upon reducing cravings for substances that people are addicted to. Addiction is known to involve the weakening of the prefrontal cortex that ordinarily allows for delaying of immediate gratification for longer term benefits by the limbic and paralimbic brain regions. Mindfulness meditation of smokers over a two-week period totaling five hours of meditation decreased smoking by about 60% and reduced their cravings, even for those smokers in the experiment who had no prior intentions to quit. Neuroimaging of those who practice mindfulness meditation has been shown to increase activity in the prefrontal cortex, a sign of greater self-control.          In 1991 Philip Barnard and John Teasdale created a multilevel theory of the mind called “Interacting Cognitive Subsystems,” (ICS). The ICS model is based on Barnard and Teasdale’s theory that the mind has multiple modes that are responsible for receiving and processing new information cognitively and emotionally. Barnard and Teasdale’s (1991) theory associates an individual’s vulnerability to depression with the degree to which he/she relies on only one of the modes of mind, inadvertently blocking the other modes. The two main modes of mind include the “doing” mode and “being” mode. The “doing” mode is also known as the driven mode. This mode is very goal-oriented and is triggered when the mind develops a discrepancy between how things are versus how the mind wishes things to be. The second main mode of mind is the “being” mode. “Being” mode, is not focused on achieving specific goals, instead the emphasis is on “accepting and allowing what is,” without any immediate pressure to change it. The central component of Barnard and Teasdale’s ICS is metacognitive awareness. Metacognitive awareness is the ability to experience negative thoughts and feelings as mental events that pass through the mind, rather than as a part of the self. Individuals with high metacognitive awareness are able to avoid depression and negative thought patterns more easily during stressful life situations, in comparison to individuals with low metacognitive awareness. Metacognitive awareness is regularly reflected through an individual’s ability to decenter. Decentering is the ability to perceive thoughts and feelings as both impermanent and objective occurrences in the mind.          Based on Barnard and Teasdale’s (1991) model, mental health is related to an individual’s ability to disengage from one mode or to easily move among the modes of mind. Therefore, individuals that are able to flexibly move between the modes of mind based on the conditions in the environment are in the most favorable state. The ICS model theorizes that the “being” mode is the most likely mode of mind that will lead to lasting emotional changes. Therefore, for prevention of relapse in depression, cognitive therapy must promote this mode. This led Teasdale to the creation of MBCT, which promotes the “being” mode.          This therapy was also created by Zindel Segal and Mark Williams, and was partially based on the mindfulness-based stress reduction program, developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn. Theories behind these mindfulness-based approaches to psychological issues function on the idea that being aware of things in the present, and not focusing on the past or the future, will allow the client to be more apt to deal with current stressors and distressing feelings with a flexible and accepting mindset, rather than avoiding, and, therefore, prolonging them.          The MBCT program is a group intervention that lasts eight weeks. During these eight weeks, there is a weekly course, which lasts two hours, and one day-long class after the fifth week. However, much of the practice is done outside of classes, where the participant uses guided meditations and attempts to cultivate mindfulness in their daily lives.          MBCT prioritizes learning how to pay attention or concentrate with purpose, in each moment and most importantly, without judgment. Through mindfulness, clients can recognize that holding onto some of these feelings is ineffective and mentally destructive. Mindfulness is also thought by Fulton et al. to be useful for the therapists as well during therapy sessions.          MBCT is an intervention program developed to specifically target vulnerability to depressive relapse. Throughout the program, patients learn mind management skills leading to heightened metacognitive awareness, acceptance of negative thought patterns and an ability to respond in skillful ways. During MBCT patients learn to decenter their negative thoughts and feelings, allowing the mind to move from an automatic thought pattern to conscious emotional processing. MBCT can be used as an alternative to maintenance antidepressant treatment, though it may be no more effective.          Although MBCT can be used as an alternative or adjunct therapy for depression, research shows that it is most effective with individuals who have a history of at least three or more past episodes of depression. Within that population, participants with life-event triggered depressive episodes were least receptive to MBCT. A 2016 meta-analysis found MBCT to be effective for preventing relapses of depressive episodes among those with depression, especially if they had more residual symptoms.          Research supports that MBCT results in increased self-reported mindfulness which suggests increased present-moment awareness, decentering, and acceptance, in addition to decreased maladaptive cognitive processes such as judgment, reactivity, rumination, and thought suppression.","['Cognitive therapy', 'Clinical psychology', 'Cognitive behavioral therapy', 'Mindfulness (psychology)']"

17133537,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17133537,Blacker's Hill,"Blacker's Hill Chilcompton is an Iron Age hill fort South West of Radstock, Somerset, England. It has been designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument.          The hill fort is roughly rectangular and is a promentary type. It covers and originally had two ramparts and two ditches, but on the west and south sides it was defended by the steep drop. In some places the ramparts survive to a considerable height but on the north east side the inner rampart and ditch have been destroyed. There are three gaps but only that on the east seems to be original.          In 1999 a geophysical survey was carried out suggesting that Blackers Hill originated as a univallate structure and was then later modified, forming a developed hill fort.          Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly the start of the first millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze, and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Power passed into the hands of a new group of people. Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated ""[the forts] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [of an increasing population] burst out into open warfare. But I wouldn't see them as having been built because there was a state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction"".","['Hill forts in Somerset', 'Scheduled Ancient Monuments in Mendip', 'History of Somerset', 'Iron Age sites in Somerset']"

His works include the concept albums, ""White Mansions"" and ""The Legend of Jesse James"". He produced and co-wrote ""The Ballad of Sally Rose"" with Emmylou Harris in 1985, and was married to Harris from 1985 to 1993.          Kennerley was born in Hoylake, Merseyside, North West England in 1948. In 1976, he was living in London and working in advertising when he first heard country music, the song ""Let's All Help the Cowboys Sing the Blues"" by Waylon Jennings. ""It really excited me,"" Kennerley recalls in his artist biography for Universal Music Group. ""I immediately hunted down every Waylon record I could find.""          Kennerley quit his job in advertising and allowed himself three months to develop his talents as a songwriter.          In 1972, Kennerley recorded an album with a rock band called 'Holy Roller' at Virgin record's newly opened Manor studio, with Tom Newman (Mike Oldfield, Tubular Bells etc.) and Philip Newell, and Newman subsequently sang all the songs on the demonstration tapes of the ""White Mansions"" album.          Kennerley's first project was ""White Mansions"", a 1978 concept album set in the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. The project was picked up by A&M Records, with Glyn Johns producing. A number of notable artists recorded the music, including Waylon Jennings, Jessi Colter, Steve Cash of the Ozark Mountain Daredevils and Eric Clapton.          In 1980, a second concept album was released, ""The Legend of Jesse James"", which featured more notable artists, including Johnny Cash, Emmylou Harris, Charlie Daniels, Albert Lee and Levon Helm.          Neither ""White Mansions"" nor ""Jesse James"" were commercially successful, but they did establish Kennerley as a serious songwriter. Among his early compositions was ""Born to Run"", which Emmylou Harris recorded in 1981 for her album, ""Cimarron"", and she continues to frequently perform the song in her concerts.          Kennerly continued to live in London while he wrote songs, but, in 1983, moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where he started working with Harris on her semi-autobiographical concept album, ""The Ballad of Sally Rose"", co-writing and producing the album. Kennerley also collaborated with Harris on her albums ""Thirteen"" and ""Bluebird"", and writing the songs ""In My Dreams"" and ""Heartbreak Hill"". He married Harris in 1985, but the couple divorced in 1993.

Lanesfield lies within the Ancient Manor of Sedgley and was a rural village for many years until the growth of the Black Country's industries. Lanesfield's name originates from the Lane family who lived where the area now stands. Originally, Lanesfield was known as Lane's Field.          During the 19th century, many houses were built in Lanesfield, particularly in Wood Street, following the industrialisation of the eastern side of the Sedgley district. Many coal mines began to appear around Lanesfield. Two miners' cottages still exist in nearby Parkfields, and are now located on the A4123 Birmingham New Road, built in 1927.          In the 1890s, because it was situated in the eastern area of Sedgley, Lanesfield was separated when the Urban District of Coseley was formed, dividing the old Manor of Sedgley in two. The Birmingham New Road was cut through the area and many new houses (private and council) were built around it soon afterwards.          Following World War II, Coseley Urban District Council built hundreds of new homes in Lanesfield.          Today, the district is mainly a residential area.           Lanesfield, together with the surrounding areas of Parkfield and Ettingshall Park, was incorporated into the Borough of Wolverhampton in 1966 when the Urban District of Coseley was abolished and the former Manor of Sedgley split between authorities.          The first school to be built in Lanesfield was Wood Street School, an infant and junior school which was opened in 1879. The old school was demolished nearly 100 years later after the construction of the new Lanesfield Primary School, a larger building in nearby Newman Avenue, which opened on 30 April 1962. The old school was still being used until December 1968 to further accommodate children on the eastern side of the Birmingham New Road from numerous new houses built at the time.          In the early 1950s, another school was built in the western part of Lanesfield - Hill Avenue Primary School. This was for the children on the western side of the Birmingham New Road.          Lanesfield featured in local news on 25 May 2013, when around 60 members of the English Defence League including leader, Tommy Robinson, blocked the Birmingham New Road at its junction with Spring Road and Rookery Road following the murder of Lee Rigby in Woolwich on 22 May 2013.",['Areas of Wolverhampton']

In his racing career, he ran in both Europe and North America, winning six races, most notably the Arlington Million as a five-year-old in 2000. Following his retirement, he showed promise as a stallion before dying at the age of eight.          Chester House was a dark bay horse bred by his owner, Khalid Abdullah's Juddmonte Farms breeding operation. He was sired by Mr. Prospector and out of the El Gran Senor mare Toussaud and was his dam's first foal. Toussaud later produced Belmont Stakes winner Empire Maker. Chester House was sent to be trained in England by Henry Cecil at his Warren Place stable in Newmarket, Suffolk.          Chester House started his record in England with a win in his first outing. He then won the class B Rosehill at Doncaster, the class A Steventon at Newbury and the class A Huxley at Chester. He recorded his first group race in the Group Three Brigadier Gerard Stakes by five lengths. After about three showings in four more graded stakes in England, his connections entered him in the 1999 Breeders' Cup Classic. Before the race, he was relocated to the United States to be trained by Robert Frankel. Chester House had no previous experience on dirt, stumbled at the start and was last for almost half of the race. He then made steady progress to finish fourth, less than three lengths behind the winner, Cat Thief. After the Classic, he remained in the United States to compete in turf races. After losing his first six starts, he won the Grade 1 Arlington Million by three lengths with Jerry Bailey riding. His connections then retired him and sent him to stud at the U.S. division of Juddmonte Farms.          Chester House showed promise as a sire of winners in a brief stud career. Most notable of his offspring is the champion mare Ventura, who won the 2008 Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Sprint and the 2009 Woodbine Mile against colts along with several other Grade 1 wins. Ventura earned over $2 million. Chester House had a second Breeders’ Cup winner in the colt Muhannak, who won the 2008 Breeders’ Cup Marathon and was a Grade 3 winner in Ireland. Chester House's other winners included grade 1 winner Divine Park; the multiple grade 2 winner Spring House (who raced for 5 seasons); grade 2 winner Warning Zone; and grade 3 winner Stonehouse, along with many more minor stakes winners. Standing at $25,000 for a guaranteed live foal, Chester House offered the Mr. Prospector blood line at a much lower price than similar stallions like Kingmambo or Fusaichi Pegasus.          In May 2003, Chester House’s handlers noticed that he wasn’t doing well. A vet visit showed he was anaemic and had contracted pneumonia. Further test showed these were secondary sicknesses as he had developed a type of cancer called Myelodysplastic Syndrome. Chemotherapy began at once in order to save his life, but the illness progressed so rapidly that Juddmonte Farms managers decided to euthanise the horse on June 28, 2003.","['Thoroughbred racehorses', '1995 racehorse births', '2003 racehorse deaths', 'Thoroughbred family 6-d']"

The act started as a folk-rock trio a year prior to the formation of the 5-piece indie-rock band ""Glass House Point"" featuring Dylan Graham on guitar and vocals, Ian Campbell on bass and Nick Wegman on banjo. At the time, Campbell, Wegman and Graham were freshmen in high school. Glass House Point was officially formed in September 2013 with the addition of drums and Dylan Methot on the electric guitar and mandolin.          Wegman later left the band due to artistic differences and was replaced by Noah Feldman (violin/piano). Jansen Valk (drums) officially joined the indie-rock act in January of 2016.           In late 2015, Glass House Point started a partnership with Hooligans Movement clothing company, becoming one of their first sponsored artists. The two have been known to affiliate at shows and events across Florida.          Glass House Point recorded their debut EP, ""Love Lives in Dark Places"", at Sound House Studios with owner/audio engineer Jonathon Gautier in downtown Lakeland, Florida. The band released their first single off the EP, ""Hungry Eyes,"" in October of 2015 and followed up shortly thereafter with the subsequent single release of ""Heaven"" in November. The 6-track EP was officially released in full on January 12th, 2016 on the band's own independent record label.          Glass House Point has become notorious in Florida for the band's ability to move and engage crowds. Throughout 2015 and 2016, Glass House Point began a local touring circuit, playing packed shows at many of Florida's largest and most renowned venues-- Backbooth, The Social, The Polk Theatre, The State Theatre, and The Orpheum being a few.

42235053,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42235053,Gideon Toury,"Gideon Toury () (born 1942) is an Israeli translation scholar and professor of Poetics, Comparative Literature and Translation Studies at Tel Aviv University, where he holds the M. Bernstein Chair of Translation Theory. Gideon Toury is a pioneer of Descriptive Translation Studies.          Gideon Toury was born in Haifa, the first child of the historian Jacob Toury (1915–2004) and his wife Eve. He completed high school at the Reali School in Haifa in 1960. After high-school, he did his military service in the Nahal Brigade and the paratroopers and as part of his training was sent to a kibbutz, to help out with the farming. He lived there for six years, and he ended up editing the kibbutz journal and organizing cultural events. This experience helped him obtaining a position in a children's journal, where he did his first translations, and later as the editor of the Hebrew version of ""Popular Photography"".          He graduated with honors in Hebrew language and Literature at Tel Aviv University in 1970, and completed a PhD Literary Theory at the same university in 1977 on the topic of ""Translational Norms and Literary Translation into Hebrew, 1930-1945"". In 1980 he won the Hans Christian Andersen Award for his translation into Hebrew of C.S. Lewis ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"". He was the first chair professor in CETRA, the research program in Translation Studies created by Jose Lambert in 1989. In 1999, he was awarded honorary membership of the UNESCO Chair of Translation Studies at Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia. In 2000, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Middlesex University, London.          From 1970 to 1983, he worked with Benjamin Harshav, Itamar Even-Zohar and Menachem Perry in the journal ""Literature"" and in 1989 he founded ""Target, International Journal of Translation Studies"" and has been general editor since. He is also General Editor of the ""Benjamins Translation Library"". He was also a member of the boards of ""The Translator"" and the ""Translation Studies Abstracts"" until he was ""unappointed"" following the decision of Mona Baker to boycott Israelite academia.          His main research is on the theory of translation and descriptive translation studies, with emphasis on the history of the Hebrew translation of the Bible to the present.          According to Toury, there are prescriptive and descriptive studies. Prescriptive approaches aim to formulate rules that should be followed by anyone who produces a text of a given type. They are focused on finding the most optimal or correct solutions. Descriptive approaches are about looking into existing texts and describing the rules they seem to follow.           He came up with the term ""translation norms"", as hidden rules followed by the majority discovered by descriptive observation of actual translation. They are not understood as prescriptive rules but as norms specific to a context. Therefore, norms change with time and culture, so translation re-visits the same problem over and over again.           He has published three books, a number of edited volumes and numerous articles, in both English and Hebrew, in the fields of translation theory and comparative literature. His articles have also appeared in translation in many other languages, and he is himself an active translator too (with about 30 books and many articles to his credit).","['1942 births', 'People from Tel Aviv', 'Tel Aviv University alumni', 'Israeli linguists', 'Translation scholars', 'Living people']"

34540507,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34540507,SS Aleutian,"SS ""Aleutian "" was a passenger ship in North American coastal service. Built in 1899 for the Ward Line as ""SS Havana"", she would later serve the building of the Panama Canal as ""SS Panama"" and ultimately enter Alaska service as ""SS Aleutian"".          In 1898 the Ward Line ordered two ships from William Cramp & Sons Shipbuilding Company in Philadelphia as part of a modernization plan in response to increased passenger and freight demand. The new passenger ship ""SS Havana"" was delivered in 1899 and briefly saw military transport service (Official Number 96435) during the Spanish American War moving two infantry units from Havana, Havana, Cuba to Savannah, Georgia. She soon joined the company’s steamers linking New York with Nassau, Havana, and Mexican Gulf ports.          ""Havana"" was sold to the Panama Railroad Steamship Company on behalf of the Isthmian Canal Commission in 1905. She was renamed ""SS Panama"" and would serve a crucial role in the construction of the Panama Canal. The steamship company was already running connecting service with New York and San Francisco. It also ran a Central American line of steamships linking Nicaragua, Costa Rica, San Salvador, and Guatemala to Panama City. The shipping service was greatly expanded as canal construction began. The line's heyday was during the construction period; once the canal was finished in 1914 the service shifted to the business of supporting the maintenance and operation of the canal and its supporting infrastructure, including the railroad.          In February 1927 ""Panama"" was sold to the Alaska Steamship Company and transferred to Pacific coastal service. Renamed ""SS Aleutian"" after the volcanic islands along the southwest Alaska coastline, the vessel received a complete overhaul and refit in Seattle. At this time she likely would have been converted from a coal to an oil fired vessel. Contemporary reports described her as palatial and she became the steamship company's flagship. She entered the company’s Alaska service carrying freight, passengers and mail service from Seattle, Washington.          On 26 May 1929 ""Aleutian"" was steaming into Uyak Bay. The weather was clear with good visibility. ""Aleutian"" suddenly shook throughout her hull. She had struck a submerged pinnacle rock that had torn into her. The ship sank just seven minutes after impact. All but one person, a crew member, made it off and survived.          ""Aleutian"" was thought to have sunk in very deep water and no salvage had been attempted. In 1998 shipwreck historian Steve Lloyd researched the testimony from the Marine Board of Inquiry hearing that had been conducted after the sinking of Aleutian. Reconstructing testimony given by ""Aleutian's"" officers he estimated the course of the ship just before the pinnacle rock had inflicted its mortal blow. In 2002 he began a side-scan sonar and a magnetometer search of the sea floor beginning at the rock that had sunk the ship. (The rock was later marked with a navigation aid and named ""Aleutian Rock"" to honor the deceased crew member.) On 14 August 2002 the searchers found a metallic target on the seabed. The discovery was confirmed when a diver descended for an inspection. On the bottom, still upright, lay ""Aleutian"". Her wreck is located just off the southern tip of Amook Island, about midway down the length of Uyak Bay at Kodiak Island.           In 2003 Lloyd sought salvage rights to the wreck. ""The cargo's still in the hold. The furniture is still in the stateroom ... spittoons still in the gentlemen's smoking room…Portions of the superstructure have collapsed, and almost all the wood is gone. But sections of the deck were steel and are still there."" In 2004 the wreck site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.           In December 2005 the state of Alaska and the discoverer’s exploration company reached a settlement that would allow artifact recovery in compliance with state’s Office of History and Archeology and environmental regulations. ""Aleutian"" is slowly deteriorating from the effects of saltwater corrosion and time. Despite the ship’s rapid sinking and time underwater she is nonetheless remarkably intact. The depth, current, and low visibility of her resting place makes her accessible only to experienced deep-wreck divers with advanced training and certification.","['1899 ships', 'Kodiak Island Borough, Alaska', 'Maritime incidents in 1929', 'Passenger ships of the United States', 'Ships of the Ward Line', 'Shipwrecks on the National Register of Historic Places in Alaska', 'National Register of Historic Places in Kodiak Island Borough, Alaska']"

8157399,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8157399,David Harris (American football),"David Charles Harris (born January 21, 1984) is an American football inside linebacker for the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the University of Michigan. Harris was selected in the second round of the 2007 NFL Draft by the Jets.          Harris attended Ottawa Hills High School in Grand Rapids, Michigan where he excelled at football. At linebacker, he set a school record with 158 tackles as a junior, and earned all-state honors from the ""Detroit Free Press"" as a senior, and he also contributed as a fullback.          Harris also participated in track and field, and this combination of size and speed led him to become one of the states top prospects.          Harris received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Michigan, where he played for the Michigan Wolverines football team. However, he was forced to redshirt as a freshman due to a knee injury which nearly derailed his career. It took nearly two years for Harris to fully recover, and he only played sparingly as a redshirt freshman and sophomore.          Not until his junior year did Harris become a full-time starter. He began to show signs of a future in the NFL when he led the Wolverines in 2005 with 88 tackles, and 103 tackles as a senior. In 2006, he earned All-Big Ten Conference honors, was Wolverines co-MVP with Mike Hart, and was a second team All-America selection by the Associated Press, ""Sports Illustrated"", and Rivals.com.          Harris was projected to go anywhere from the late-second round to the fourth round prior to the 2007 NFL Draft. However, he impressed scouts when he ran a 4.59 40 yard dash at the NFL Combine. He drew interest from the New York Jets, due partially to new linebackers coach Jim Herrmann who had previously been defensive coordinator for Harris' Michigan Wolverines.          Harris was drafted in the 2nd round (47th overall) of the 2007 NFL Draft by the New York Jets. The Jets sent their 2nd, 3rd, and 6th picks that year to the Green Bay Packers in exchange for the Packers 2nd rounder to select Harris.          On Sunday, October 28, 2007, Harris recorded his first NFL start, making 17 tackles (10 solo) and 1 sack in against the Buffalo Bills. Harris started in place of injured LB Jonathan Vilma who was placed on injured reserve after a knee injury. Harris made 24 tackles (20 solo) the following week against the Washington Redskins. In 2007, Harris was named NFL’s Defensive Rookie of the Month for November 2007.          For the 2007 NFL season, Harris had 127 tackles, 5 sacks, and two forced fumbles despite only starting 9 games, and earned various all-rookie honors.          In late February, the Jets traded MLB Jonathan Vilma to the New Orleans Saints, and Harris was named the starter at Inside linebacker for the 2008 season. Although an injury shortened season limited Harris to just 11 games, he still posted 87 tackles and 1 sack.          Against the Houston Texans in the first week of the season, Harris finished with 11 tackles (six solo), one sack, and a deflected pass as the defense pitched a shutout. Harris also won AFC Defensive Player of the Week for his play. In week three, as his team was only up seven points, he intercepted a Kerry Collins pass, and then followed that drive by sacking him on first down during the Tennessee Titans next series. Harris himself had 12 tackles, (ten solo). During the Jets' week six game against the Buffalo Bills, Harris recorded 17 tackles. In week 11 against division rivals, Harris recorded 13 tackles (ten solo) as he earned defensive play caller for the Jets that week.          Harris finished his season as the leading tackler on football's number one defense with 127 tackles. He also chipped in with five and a half sacks and two interceptions. In addition, he made second team all-pro.          Harris led the Jets into the AFC Championship for the first time since 1998 until losing to the Indianapolis Colts.          On January 16, 2011, Harris recorded his first career postseason interception in which he returned it for 58 yards against the New England Patriots in the AFC Divisional Round. Jets won 28-21 to advance to their second straight AFC Championship game. It was Tom Brady's first Interception in 11 games (340 pass attempts without an interception). He led the Jets into the AFC Championship for the 2nd year in a row but dropped 19-24 against the Pittsburgh Steelers.          Harris recorded 86 tackles, 5 sacks along with 4 interceptions in the 2011 season. On November 9, 2011, Harris was named AFC’s Defensive Player of the Week for his performance against the Buffalo Bills.          Harris recorded 123 combined tackles, 3 sacks, 3 passes defended and one forced fumble.          Harris finished the season with 124 combined tackles, 2 sacks, one passes defended and one forced fumble.          Harris finished the season with 123 combined tackles along with five and half sacks and two forced fumbles.          On March 6, 2015, the Jets re-signed Harris to a three-year, $21.5 million contract with $15 million guaranteed. In 16 starts, he made 108 tackles with 4.5 sacks, 4 passes defended, and 2 forced fumbles.          He currently resides in Parsippany, New Jersey.

The Taj Mahal in Agra was constructed by her husband as her final resting place.          She was born as Arjumand Banu Begum in Agra into a family of Persian nobility as a daughter of Abdul Hasan Asaf Khan, making her a niece and later, a stepdaughter-in-law of Empress Nur Jehan, the wife of the emperor Jahangir. Arjumand Banu Begum was married at the age of 19, on 10 May 1613, to Prince Khurram, later known as Emperor Shah Jahan, who conferred upon her the title ""Mumtaz Mahal"". Although betrothed to Shah Jahan in 1607, she ultimately became his 4th wife in 1612 and was his one of the favourites. She died in Burhanpur in the Deccan (now in Madhya Pradesh) during the birth of their fourteenth child, a daughter named Gauhara Begum.          Mumtaz Mahal mothered fourteen children by Shah Jahan, including Aurangzeb; the Imperial Prince Dara Shikoh, the heir apparent anointed by Shah Jahan, who temporarily succeeded Shah Jahan until deposed by his brother Aurangzeb; and Jahanara Begum, the Imperial Princess.          Arjumand Banu Begum was born in Agra in a family of Persian nobility as a daughter of Abdul Hasan Asaf Khan, making her a niece (and later daughter-in-law) of Empress Nur Jehan, the wife of the emperor Jahangir. Her older sister, Parwar Khanum, married Sheikh Farid, the son of Nawab Qutubuddin Koka, the governor of Badaun who was also the emperor Jahangir's foster brother. Empress Mumtaz was religiously a Shia Muslim.          In 1607 AD (1016 AH), Prince Khurram, also known as Shah Jahan, was betrothed to Arjumand Banu Begum who was just 14 years          old at the time, but would nonetheless become the unquestioned love of his life. They would, however, have to wait five years before they were married in 1612 AD (1021 AH), on a date selected by the court astrologers as most conducive to ensuring a happy marriage. After their wedding celebrations, Khurram ""finding her in appearance and character elect among all the women of the time"", gave her the title ""Mumtaz Mahal"" Begum (Chosen One of the Palace). 18 AH). The intervening years had seen Khurram take two other wives. But by all accounts however, Khurram was so taken with Mumtaz that he showed little interest in exercising his polygamous rights with the two earlier wives, other than dutifully siring a child with each. According to the official court chronicler, Motamid Khan (as recorded in his Iqbal Namah-e-Jahangiri), the relationship with his other wives ""had nothing more than the status of marriage. The intimacy, deep affection, attention and favour which His Majesty had for the Cradle of Excellence (Mumtaz) exceeded by a thousand times what he felt for any other."" Therefore,Shah Jahan bestowed Mumtaj with luxuries that no other queen was given. For example, no other queen's residence was as decorated as Khas Mahal (part of Agra fort), where Mumtaz lived with Shah Jahan. It was decorated with pure gold and precious stones and had rose water fountains of its own.          Mumtaz Mahal had a deep and loving marriage with Shah Jahan. Even during her lifetime, poets would extol her beauty, grace, and compassion. She was Shah Jahan's trusted companion, travelling with him all over the Mughal Empire. His trust in her was so great that he even gave her his imperial seal, the Muhr Uzah. Mumtaz was portrayed as having no aspirations to political power in contrast to her aunt, Empress Nur Jehan, the chief consort of Emperor Jahangir, who had wielded considerable influence in the previous reign. A great influence on him, apparently often intervening on behalf of the poor and destitute, she also enjoyed watching elephant and combat fights performed for the court. It was quite common for women of noble birth to commission architecture in the Mughal Empire, so Mumtaz devoted some time to a riverside garden in Agra.          Despite her frequent pregnancies, Mumtaz travelled with Shah Jahan's entourage throughout his earlier military campaigns and the subsequent rebellion against his father. She was his constant companion and trusted confidant, leading court historians to go to unheard lengths to document the intimate and erotic relationship the couple enjoyed. In their nineteen years of marriage, they had fourteen children together, seven of whom died at birth or at a very young age.          When Shah Jahan travelled from Balapur Fort to Burhanpur, mother of Mirza Azam and elder daughter of Shahzada Mirza Badi-uz-Zaman Safavi, alias Shah Nawaz Khan of the Safavid dynasty, the princess Dilras Banu Begum, wife of Aurangzeb along with Mumtaz and cousin/brother Shah Beg Khan, along with military personnel - stayed three nights near Argaon at Hiwarkhed, before the birth of their fourteenth child.          Mumtaz Mahal died in Burhanpur in 1631 AD (1040 AH) while giving birth to her fourteenth child. She had been accompanying her husband while he was fighting a campaign in the Deccan Plateau. Her body was temporarily buried at Burhanpur in a walled pleasure garden known as Zainabad originally constructed by Shah Jahan's uncle Daniyal on the bank of the Tapti River. The contemporary court chroniclers paid an unusual amount of attention to Mumtaz Mahal's death and Shah Jahan's grief at her demise. In the immediate aftermath of his bereavement, the emperor was reportedly inconsolable. Apparently after her death, Shah Jahan went into secluded mourning for a year. When he appeared again, his hair had turned white, his back was bent, and his face worn. Shah Jahan's eldest daughter, Jahanara Begum, gradually brought him out of grief and took the place of Mumtaz at court.          Her personal fortune (valued at 10,000,000 rupees) was divided by Shah Jahan between Jahanara Begum, who received half and the rest of her surviving children. Burhanpur was never intended by her husband as his wife's final resting spot. As a result, her body was disinterred in December 1631 and transported in a golden casket escorted by her son Shah Shuja and the head lady in waiting of the deceased Empress back to Agra. There it was interred in a small building on the banks of the Yamuna River. Shah Jahan stayed behind in Burhanpur to conclude the military campaign that had originally brought him to the region. While there, he began planning the design and construction of a suitable mausoleum and funerary garden in Agra for his wife. It was a task that would take more than 22 years to complete: the Taj Mahal.          A crater was named in her honour on asteroid 433 Eros, along with another one after her husband.","['1593 births', '1631 deaths', 'Deaths in childbirth', 'Indian female royalty', 'Indian Muslims', 'Indian Shia Muslims', 'Islam and women', 'Mughal nobility', 'People from Agra', 'Persian women', 'Royal consorts', 'Taj Mahal', 'Women of the Mughal Empire', 'Indian queen consorts']"

28106035,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28106035,Mohamed Salah Ben Mrad,"Mohamed Salah Ben Mrad (1881–1979) was a Tunisian theologian, journalist and intellectual. In 1931 he published ""Mourning on Haddad's Woman"" (ﺍﻟﺤﺪﺍﺩ ﻋﻠﻰ ﺍﻣﺮأﺓ ﺍﻟﺤﺪﺍﺩ) objecting to the expanded rights for women which were advocated by Tahar Haddad in his book ""Our Women in the Sharia and Society"" published one year earlier.          Born in the Medina of Tunis near the Tourbet El Bey, Mohamed Salah was the son of the Hanafi Bach-mufti, Sheikh H'mida Ben Mrad, a specialist in rhetoric and the elder brother of the sheikhs Neji (who served as qadi and mufti) and Brahim Ben Mrad (who served as imam,teacher at the Zaytuna,judge at the Tunis tribunal). He came from a family of Tunis scholars and intellectuals of Ottoman origin, from Turkey. Dating back to the seventeenth century, his grandfather Murad Khodja was part of the military army of Sinan Pasha, who participated in the battle of La Goulette against the army of Charles V in 1574.           He completed his studies at the Zaytuna and left in 1900.          Ben Mrad, a book entitled: Mourning Haddad's Women (الحداد على امرأة الحداد), was published in 193, where he rejects the ideas of Tahar Haddad on the Status of Women in Tunisia, based on the scriptural texts of the Koran. The book follows an outcry from scholars of the court of Sharia and much of the population were in favor of the new ideas of Haddad. He defends the idea of wearing ""sefseri"" by Tunisian women which he finds is not a sign of religious identification, but a more traditional dress akin to a national uniform that was shared by all social groups. He also rejects the idea that social reforms can be accomplished without the time necessary for their understanding and assimilation by a colonized population still largely illiterate. According to him, the emancipation of Tunisian women must come first through instruction and education . He acknowledged however that some ideas of Haddad are not opposed to the Sharia on the Status of Women. This was done in the journal that he founded in 1937 - Shams al-Islam (The sun of Islam).          He was appointed as the Sheikh el Islam in the kingdom by Moncef Bey in 1942. After the removal of the latter, on the occasion of the inauguration of the new Bey Lamine by General Alphonse Juin, he insisted, in his speech to the king, on his role as guarantor of the monarchy and the Husseinite throne, suggesting that there is a void left by Moncef Bey in the heart of Tunisians. In 1944 he helped set up the reform commission's Zaytuna University, chaired by Sheikh Mohammed and President Tahar Ben Achour, responding to the wishes of Tunisian intellectuals and zeytounien students, concerned about the future of the oldest university in the Arab-Muslim world. Under pressure from the Resident General of France in Tunisia Charles Mast, Sheikh Ben Mrad was dismissed from his post in 1946, because of his political commitment to nationalist leaders of the Neo-Destour imprisoned and exiled, and in favor of the union movement of the General Union of Tunisian Workers - Farhat Hached.          His daughter, Bchira Ben Mrad, founded in 1937, the first women's organization: Tunisian Union of Muslim women in Tunisia, with the support of her father and sisters, getting numerous articles published in the journal of her father. Contrary to what some thought, the sheikh gave a modern education to his daughters that closely mingled with the intellectual and cultural life in Tunis.","['Tunisian people of Turkish descent', 'Tunisian theologians', 'Tunisian journalists', 'Tunisian writers', '1909 births', '1970 deaths', 'Writers from Tunis']"
21812901,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21812901,Philadelphia (band),"Philadelphia was a Christian metal band from Shreveport, Louisiana. The ""Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music"" describes them as having been unjustly condemned by ""the slings and arrows of fundamentalist bigotry"" for their musical style and lyrics. Their name is a reference to the church of Philadelphia in Revelation 3 verses 7-10.          Musically, the band was characterized as being ""Harder than Rez and more intense than Daniel Band and Barnabas.""          The band was originally a general market band called Survivor. After breaking up in 1981, the members found Christianity through independent experiences. They reunited in 1982 as a Christian band and produced their first LP, ""Tell The Truth"" in 1984. Their styling was not well received by the entire Christian community, for which metal was still a fringe sound. While one publication found that the band emphasized ""ministry and outreach through their direct and hard hitting lyrics,"" others saw the same as inappropriately descriptive and judgmental. For their lyrics and style the band garnered the scorn of some national religious media.          In 1985 the band appeared at Cornerstone and released a second album entitled ""Search and Destroy"". Its lyrics were controversial as well, as the release tackled social issues such as child abuse, drug abuse and runaways through the eyes of a character named Bobby. One reviewer called the result an ""overly serious tone and melodramatic feel."" Brian Clark responded to the bands critics, stating that ""Bobby is part and parcel of all these American tragedies, and Jesus is shown to be real and relevant.""          A third project entitled ""Warlord"" was planned, and tracks recorded, but never released. Some tracks from the project, along with a few newly recorded ones, were rereleased by M8 Records along with their studio albums in 2000.          Their third album, ""Warlord"", was released in 2016, thirty years later, on the band's own label, Philly Music. Members are the original core trio, Brian Martini on drums, Phil Scholling on guitars and Brian 'Wulfie' Clark on bass and vocals. The title track is the same one written 30 years ago, recorded in the studio for the first time, with the balance of the release all new material written by Scholling and Clark.","['American Christian metal musical groups', 'Heavy metal musical groups from Louisiana']"

Founded by Ernest T. Weir in 1909 as Weirton Steel, the company later became part of the National Steel Corporation. In 1983, employees agreed to purchase the operation from National Steel and form into an employee-owned corporation. In the last years of its life, Weirton withered away and filed for bankruptcy protection on May 19, 2003. The International Steel Group purchased Weirton and formed ISG Weirton Inc. in 2004.           ISG was sold to Mittal Steel, which currently is in the process of downsizing the mill.          Weirton Steel Corporation was an integrated steel mill founded in 1909 by Ernest T. Weir, who built Weirton Steel into one of the world's leading steel producers. In 1905 Weir and his partner, James Phillips, bought a tin mill in Clarksburg, West Virginia. In 1909, the partners successfully relocated and expanded the operation in what was then Hollidays Cove, West Virginia. They chose Hollidays Cove because of its abundant water supply. The water was much needed for steel production, and offered ready access to major steel markets.          In 1929, Weir merged Weirton Steel with Detroit's Michigan Steel and Cleveland's M. A. Hanna Company to form National Steel Corporation. National Steel quickly took a place among the nation's largest steel producers.          However, toward the end of the century Weirton Steel had fallen on hard times. In the early 1980s it was purchased from National Steel by the employees, thus at that time, making it the world's largest Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).          This was not enough to ensure the long-term viability of the company. It finally went bankrupt in the early 21st century just short of its 100th birthday. By court order, the assets were auctioned with most being acquired by ISG. ISG then formed a new division called ISG Weirton Steel. On April 5, 2005, ISG completed a merger with Mittal Steel. Then again in 2006, Mittal Steel completed a merger with Arcelor thus resulting in a new company known as Arcelor Mittal.","['ArcelorMittal', 'Companies established in 1909', 'Steel companies of the United States']"

He played as a centre half or left half.          Ormiston was born in Peebles, Scotland. He played non-league football in England for Hebburn Argyle, before joining Football League Second Division club Lincoln City in 1907. The club finished bottom of the division in 1908, and failed to gain re-election to the League. Ormiston helped Lincoln win their second Midland League title in 1908–09, and then followed former Lincoln manager David Calderhead to First Division club Chelsea. He played just over 100 matches in senior competition over five years, and made a solid contribution to Chelsea's return to the First Division in 1912, but his career with the club effectively ended in April 1914 when he suffered a serious ankle injury in a match at Bradford City.          He guested for former club Lincoln during the war, and signed for them when competitive football resumed in 1919. On the opening day of the 1919–20 season, as Lincoln earned an unexpected draw against West Ham United, who were playing their first match after joining the Football League from the Southern League, Ormiston's experience made him stand out: He played his last game for Lincoln in December 1919, and returned to Scotland, where he appeared for Peebles Rovers.

1491853,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1491853,Chris Eagles,"Christopher Mark ""Chris"" Eagles (born 19 November 1985) is an English footballer who last played for Bury. Primarily a winger, he can also play as an attacking midfielder. After coming through the youth system at Watford, he began his professional career with Manchester United, but was unable to break into the first team. He had two loan spells back at Watford, as well as with Sheffield Wednesday and Dutch club N.E.C., before a permanent move to Burnley in 2008. He has also played for Bolton Wanderers, Blackpool, Charlton Athletic and Bury.          Eagles was born in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, and was a season ticket holder at Tottenham Hotspur, whom he went to see with his family. Originally coming through the youth system at Watford, Eagles left when he was 14 to join the Manchester United academy. The compensation owed to Watford for this move would later form part of the package which took Danny Webber in the opposite direction.          Eagles made his first-team debut for Manchester United on 28 October 2003 as a second-half substitute for Kieran Richardson in an extra-time win away to Leeds United in the League Cup. He played once more that season, this time as a substitute for Cristiano Ronaldo as United lost 2–0 away to West Bromwich Albion in a League Cup Fourth Round tie.          On 21 December 2006, Eagles decided to take the option of returning to Manchester United after struggling to get many games on loan at Dutch Eredivisie side N.E.C. He only made 11 appearances for N.E.C., with the majority coming as a substitute. On 13 March 2007, Eagles featured in the second half for United in an exhibition match at Old Trafford against Marcello Lippi's Europe XI.          On 28 April 2007, Eagles scored his first senior goal for United in a 4–2 Premier League win over Everton. After coming on as a second-half substitute, he scored a 93rd-minute goal to put the result beyond doubt and putting Manchester United five points clear in their race for the Premier League title. On 20 July 2007, during Manchester United's tour of Asia, he scored in a friendly match against FC Seoul. He also scored a spectacular 35-yard volley in a friendly match against Shenzhen FC four days later, bringing his total for the tour to three goals in five games. Eagles scored another pre-season goal the following year, netting United's equaliser against Kaizer Chiefs to earn a 1–1 draw. He also started in the pre-season game against Portsmouth in Nigeria, scoring United's opening goal.          Eagles was loaned to Watford on 21 January 2005, for whom he made 13 appearances and scored one goal (against Gillingham). He was also loaned to Sheffield Wednesday for the first half of the 2005–06 season. He scored his first goal for Sheffield Wednesday in their derby match against Leeds. He ended his loan spell with a total of three goals for Wednesday.          On 6 January 2006, Eagles was again loaned to Watford, making his debut against his future employers Bolton Wanderers in the FA Cup, with the Hornets going down 3–0. In his first league appearance for Watford against Stoke City, he scored the only goal of the match for Watford. His winning goal in the 1–0 away win at Brighton & Hove Albion on 18 February from 50 yards (almost the halfway line) – reminiscent of David Beckham's goal for Manchester United against Wimbledon a decade earlier – won him the club's goal of the season award. He also scored the first goal in the 4–1 thrashing away at Sheffield United, and David Unsworth was sent off for elbowing him. Having played almost every game for the Hornets since his loan move, Eagles was put on the bench for the play-off games.          On 31 August 2006, Eagles agreed to spend four months on loan at Dutch outfit N.E.C., in order to gain more experience.          On 29 July 2008, Eagles signed for Burnley on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee. Manager Owen Coyle said, ""He can play as a striker, or behind the striker or wide or as a central midfielder. He gives you a host of variations, but outwith that he's a talented footballer and that's what we want – young exciting talents to complement the quality we already have."" Eagles made his league debut for Burnley on 9 August 2008 in a 4–1 loss to Sheffield Wednesday. On 27 September 2008, he scored his first goal for Burnley in a 3–1 victory over rivals Preston North End, scoring in the 95th minute.          In July 2010, the Clarets accepted a bid from Scottish champions Rangers to buy Eagles, but the player was unable to agree terms with the Scottish club and remained in England. He went on to score 15 goals in 48 appearances in his final season with Burnley.          On 29 July 2011, Eagles and his Burnley team-mate Tyrone Mears joined Bolton Wanderers on three-year contract for a joint fee in the region of £3 million, linking up with their ex-manager Owen Coyle for a second time in their careers. He made his debut in a 4–0 away win at Queens Park Rangers on 13 August, where he created an assist for the second goal put in his own net by Danny Gabbidon. On 20 September, he scored his first goal for Bolton, from 25 yards, in the League Cup Third Round 2–0 away win against Aston Villa. His first League goal for Bolton came on 15 October in a 3–1 win away to Wigan Athletic, where he also assisted the first goal, an own goal by Gary Caldwell. He also scored a brace in the 5–0 home win against Stoke City on 6 November. He found himself out of the starting line-up for a few games for a while due to Tuncay Şanlı being in form, but he came back to the starting line-up on 21 April 2012, where he scored in a 1–1 draw at home to Swansea City, and kept his place the following game, in the 2–1 away win to Aston Villa, where he provided the assist for the winning goal from David N'Gog. At the end of the season, Bolton were relegated to the Championship.          Eagles became a key player for Bolton upon their return to the Championship and was Bolton's top scorer from early in the season, scoring six times in the first few months against Derby County, Nottingham Forest, Hull City, Birmingham City, Millwall and Bristol City but despite being named Player of the Month by the fans for August, September and October of the new season, Bolton were in the bottom half of the table. Following Owen Coyle's sacking Dougie Freedman said that he wanted to base his team around Eagles. In 2013 Bolton's fortunes changed as they went from 20th to 6th within two months. However, come the end of the season they finished seventh meaning that they did not make the play-off places.          Eagles finished the season as Bolton's top goalscorer with twelve goals, and also created the most number of goals, with twelve assists. His form in April earned him a nomination for the Football League Championship Player of the Month.          At the end of the 2013–14 season he was released by the club along with Zat Knight, Tyrone Mears and Jay Lynch. Eagles played only 18 times in his last season at the club.          Shortly after his release from Bolton, he explained that he was disappointed at aspects of his departure, but maintained an affection for both the club's supporters and the town.          On 18 November 2014, Eagles joined Blackpool on a short term contract until January 2015. After leaving Blackpool, Eagles signed for Charlton Athletic on 19 February 2015 on a free transfer until the end of the 2014–15 season. Eagles was released at the end of his contract and subsequently joined Football League One club Bury in October 2015 on a contract until the end of the season.          In July 2014, Eagles was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Bolton for his services to sport.","['1985 births', 'Association football wingers', 'Blackpool F.C. players', 'Bolton Wanderers F.C. players', 'Burnley F.C. players', 'Charlton Athletic F.C. players', 'English expatriate footballers', 'English footballers', 'Eredivisie players', 'Expatriate footballers in the Netherlands', 'Footballers from Hertfordshire', 'People from Hemel Hempstead', 'Living people', 'Manchester United F.C. players', 'NEC Nijmegen players', 'People associated with the University of Bolton', 'Premier League players', 'Sheffield Wednesday F.C. players', 'The Football League players', 'Watford F.C. players']"
10909234,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10909234,List of birds of Saint Lucia,"This is a list of the bird species recorded in Saint Lucia. The avifauna of Saint Lucia include a total of 177 species, of which seven are endemic, one has been introduced by humans and 107 are rare or accidental. Six species are globally threatened.          This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of ""The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World"", 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total count for Saint Lucia.          The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. Not all species fall into one of these categories. Those that do not are commonly occurring native species.          Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae          Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land.          Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae          The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized ""true petrels"", characterised by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary.          Order: PhaethontiformesFamily: Phaethontidae          Tropicbirds are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their heads and long wings have black markings.          Order: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae          The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish.          Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae          Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage colouration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white and a few being colourful.          Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae          Darters are often called ""snake-birds"" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving.          Order: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae          Frigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black and white or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have coloured inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week.          Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Pelecanidae          Pelicans are large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak. As with other members of the order Pelecaniformes, they have webbed feet with four toes.          Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Ardeidae          The family Ardeidae contains the bitterns, herons and egrets. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills.          Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Threskiornithidae          Threskiornithidae is a family of large terrestrial and wading birds which includes the ibises and spoonbills. They have long, broad wings with 11 primary and about 20 secondary feathers. They are strong fliers and despite their size and weight, very capable soarers.          Order: PhoenicopteriformesFamily: Phoenicopteridae          Flamingos are gregarious wading birds, usually tall, found in both the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. Flamingos filter-feed on shellfish and algae. Their oddly shaped beaks are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they consume and, uniquely, are used upside-down.          Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae          Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating.          Order: AccipitriformesFamily: Pandionidae          The Pandionidae family contains only one species, the osprey. The osprey is a medium-large raptor which is a specialist fish-eater with a worldwide distribution.          Order: AcciptriformesFamily: Accipitridae          Accipitridae is a family of birds of prey, which includes hawks, eagles, kites, harriers and Old World vultures. These birds have powerful hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful talons and keen eyesight.          Order: FalconiformesFamily: Falconidae          Falconidae is a family of diurnal birds of prey. They differ from hawks, eagles and kites in that they kill with their beaks instead of their talons.          Order: GruiformesFamily: Rallidae          Rallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots and gallinules. Typically they inhabit dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers.

Order: PasseriformesFamily: Fringillidae          Finches are seed-eating passerine birds, that are small to moderately large and have a strong beak, usually conical and in some species very large. All have twelve tail feathers and nine primaries. These birds have a bouncing flight with alternating bouts of flapping and gliding on closed wings, and most sing well.          Order: PasseriformesFamily: Emberizidae          The emberizids are a large family of passerine birds. They are seed-eating birds with distinctively shaped bills. In Europe, most species are called buntings. In North America, most of the species in this family are known as sparrows, but these birds are not closely related to the Old World sparrows which are in the family Passeridae. Many emberizid species have distinctive head patterns.          Order: PasseriformesFamily: Cardinalidae          The cardinals are a family of robust, seed-eating birds with strong bills. They are typically associated with open woodland. The sexes usually have distinct plumages.

510840,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=510840,Bennett Cerf,"Bennett Alfred Cerf (May 25, 1898 – August 27, 1971) was an American publisher, one of the founders of American publishing firm Random House. Cerf was also known for his own compilations of jokes and puns, for regular personal appearances lecturing across the United States, and for his television appearances in the panel game show ""What's My Line?""          Bennett was born on May 25, 1898 in Manhattan, New York to a Jewish family of Alsatian and German origin. Cerf's father Gustave Cerf was a lithographer; his mother Frederika Wise was heiress to a tobacco-distribution fortune. She died when Bennett was fifteen; shortly afterward, her brother Herbert moved into the Cerf household and became a strong literary and social influence on the teenager.          Cerf attended Townsend Harris High School, the same public school as publisher Richard Simon and playwright Howard Dietz. He spent his teenage years at 790 Riverside Drive, an apartment building in Washington Heights that was home to two friends who became prominent as adults: Howard Dietz and Hearst newspapers financial editor Merryle Rukeyser. He received his Bachelor of Arts from Columbia College of Columbia University (1919) and his Litt.B. (1920) from its School of Journalism. After graduation, he briefly worked as a reporter for the ""New York Herald Tribune"" and for some time in a Wall Street brokerage. He then was named a vice-president of the publishing firm Boni & Liveright.          In 1925, Cerf and Donald S. Klopfer formed a partnership to purchase the rights to the Modern Library from Boni & Liveright, and they went into business for themselves. They increased the popularity of the series and, in 1927, they began publishing general trade books which they had selected ""at random."" This began their publishing business, which in time they named Random House. It used as its logo a little house drawn by Cerf's friend and fellow Columbia alumnus Rockwell Kent.          Cerf's talent in building and maintaining relationships brought contracts with such writers as William Faulkner, John O'Hara, Eugene O'Neill, James Michener, Truman Capote, Theodor Seuss Geisel, and others. He published ""Atlas Shrugged,"" written by Ayn Rand, even though he vehemently disagreed with her philosophy of Objectivism. He admired her ""sincerity"" and ""brillian[ce],"" and the two became lifelong friends.          In 1933, Cerf won ""United States v. One Book Called Ulysses,"" a landmark court case against government censorship, and thereafter he published James Joyce's unabridged ""Ulysses"" for the first time in the United States. (One chapter had been published in Margaret Anderson's and Jane Heap's ""The Little Review,"" a Chicago-based literary magazine, which had led to its being found ""a work of obscenity."") In 1933, Random House had the rights to publish the book in the United States, and they arranged for a test case to challenge the implicit ban so as to publish the work without fear of prosecution. The publisher therefore made an arrangement to import the French edition of the book and to have a copy seized by the United States Customs Service when the ship arrived carrying the work. Despite advance warning to Customs of the anticipated arrival of the book, the local official declined to confiscate it, stating that ""everybody brings that in."" He and his superior were finally convinced to seize the work. The United States Attorney then took seven months before deciding whether to proceed further. The Assistant U.S. Attorney assigned to assess the work's obscenity felt that it was a ""literary masterpiece""—yet he also found it obscene within the meaning of the law. The office, therefore, decided to take action against the work under the provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930, which allowed a district attorney to bring action. Cerf later presented the French-language book to Columbia University.          In 1944, Cerf published the first of his collection of joke books ""Try and Stop Me,"" with illustrations drawn by Carl Rose. A second book ""Shake Well Before Using"" was published in 1949. It was at this time that he became a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors, serving from 1946 through 1967, then returning to the board from 1970 to 1971. Additionally, he served as Chair Juror of the Peabody Jurors Board from 1954 to the end of his first term in 1967 and published a weekly column titled ""The Cerf Board,"" in the Sunday supplement magazine ""This Week.""           In the early 1950s, while maintaining a Manhattan residence, Cerf bought an estate at Mount Kisco, New York which became his country home for the rest of his life. A Mount Kisco street named Cerf Lane runs from Croton Avenue and is named after him. Cerf married actress Sylvia Sidney on October 1, 1935; they divorced seven months later on April 9, 1936. He married Hollywood actress Phyllis Fraser, a cousin of Ginger Rogers, on September 17, 1940. They had two sons, Christopher and Jonathan.          In 1959, Maco Magazine Corporation published what became known as ""The Cream of the Master's Crop,"" a compilation of Cerf's jokes, gags, stories, puns, and wit.          Prior to 1951, Cerf was an occasional panelist on the NBC game show ""Who Said That?"", in which celebrities try to determine the speaker of quotations taken from recent news reports. In 1951, he began appearing weekly on ""What's My Line?"" and continued until the show ended its run on CBS in 1967. Until his death, Cerf continued to appear regularly on the CBS Films, Inc. (now Viacom) syndicated version of ""What's My Line?"", along with Arlene Francis. Cerf was known as ""Bennett Snerf"" in a ""Sesame Street"" puppet parody of ""What's My Line?"". During his time on ""What's My Line?"", Cerf received an honorary degree from the University of Puget Sound.          Cerf was interviewed in 1967 and 1968 by Robin Hawkins, a freelancer working for the Oral History Research Office at Columbia University. He claimed that, of all the awards which he'd received in his life, he was ""genuinely proud of"" those bestowed on him by humor magazines ""The Yale Record"" and ""The Harvard Lampoon"".          Cerf was the subject of Jessica Mitford's exposé, published in the June 1970 issue of ""Atlantic Monthly,"" which denounced the business practices of the Famous Writers School which Cerf had founded.          Cerf was portrayed in the film ""Infamous"" (2006) by Peter Bogdanovich. S.J. Perelman's feuilleton ""No Dearth of Mirth, Fill Out the Coupon"" describes Perelman's fictionalized encounter with a jokebook publisher named Barnaby Chirp who is a caricature of Cerf. Another caricature of Cerf is named Harry Hubris and portrayed by Bert Lahr, and appears in Perelman's 1962 play ""The Beauty Part"". He was also referred to as publisher ""Bennett Blake"" in an episode of ""The Patty Duke Show"".          Cerf died from natural causes in Mount Kisco, New York, on August 27, 1971, aged 73, survived by his wife and sons.          In 1977 Random House published his autobiography, which he had titled ""At Random: The Reminiscences of Bennett Cerf"".          Bennett Cerf Drive just outside the City of Westminster in Carroll County, Maryland is named after him. This is the location of one of two Random House distribution facilities in the U.S., known as the Random House Westminster Distribution Center & Offices, and also a park, Bennett Cerf Park.","['1898 births', '1971 deaths', 'American book publishers (people)', 'American Jews', 'American people of German-Jewish descent', 'American television personalities', 'Jewish American writers', 'Random House', 'Townsend Harris High School alumni', 'Columbia University alumni', 'Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism alumni']"

23616237,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23616237,Natalya Estemirova,"Natalya Khusainovna Estemirova (; 28 February 1958 – 15 July 2009) was an award-winning Russian human rights activist and board member of the Russian human rights organization Memorial. Estemirova was abducted by unknown persons on 15 July 2009 around 8:30 a.m. from her home in Grozny, Chechnya, as she was working on ""extremely sensitive"" cases of human rights abuses in Chechnya. Two witnesses reported they saw Estemirova being pushed into a car shouting that she was being abducted. Her remains were found with bullet wounds in the head and chest area at 4:30 p.m. in woodland away from the federal road ""Kavkaz"" near the village of Gazi-Yurt, Ingushetia.          Born in Kamyshlov, Sverdlovsk Oblast to Russian and Chechen parents, Estemirova graduated with a degree in history from Grozny University and taught history in a local high school until 1998. In 1991, she worked as a correspondent for the local newspapers ""The Voice"" and ""The Worker of Grozny"". While working on TV in Grozny, she filmed thirteen short documentaries about victims of the Russian punitive practices. She participated in the Organization of Filtration Camps Inmates as a press-secretary. The widow of a Chechen policeman, she gathered evidence on human rights violations since the beginning of the Second Chechen war in 1999, leaving her daughter in Yekaterinburg with relatives. In 2000, she became a representative for the Memorial Human Rights Centre in her native Grozny. She visited many hospitals in Chechnya and Ingushetia, taking hundreds of photographs of child victims of the war.          Estemirova was a frequent contributor to the independent Moscow newspaper ""Novaya Gazeta"" and the Caucasus news website Kavkazsky Uzel.          Estemirova received the Right Livelihood Award at a ceremony in the Swedish parliament building in 2004. Along with Sergey Kovalyov, chairman of Memorial, she was awarded the Robert Schuman Medal by the Group of the European People's Party in 2005. In October 2007, she was awarded the first Anna Politkovskaya Award by Reach All Women in War (RAW), a human rights organization supporting women human rights defenders in war and conflict (see also Anna Politkovskaya Award). Estemirova worked with investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya and human rights lawyer Stanislav Markelov, both of whom were also murdered, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.          Estemirova was abducted on 15 July 2009 from her home in Grozny, Chechnya. According to Tanya Lokshina of the Moscow bureau of Human Rights Watch, unknown individuals abducted Estemirova near her house in Grozny at around 8:30 a.m. Her colleagues raised an alert when she did not come to a planned meeting and went to her home, found witnesses and questioned them. Two witnesses reportedly saw Estemirova being pushed into a car shouting that she was being abducted. Lokshina said Estemirova was abducted as she was working on ""extremely sensitive"" cases of human rights abuses in Chechnya. Lokshina said that she had been targeted for her professional activities. Human Rights Watch had demanded to the Kremlin and Ramzan Kadyrov that Estemirova be returned home safely.          Vladimir Markin, press secretary for the investigative committee of the Prosecutor General of Russia, said a body of a woman with bullet wounds in the head and chest was found at 4:30 p.m. in woodland 100 m away from the federal road ""Kavkaz"" near the village of Gazi-Yurt, Ingushetia. Investigators found items belonging to Estemirova in the purse of the woman. These items were a passport, an ID of the Chechnya expert for the Human Rights Commissioner of Russia and the mandate of the penitentiary supervision public committee.          Estemirova was ""buried in line with Islamic tradition before sunset on Thursday, in a cemetery in her ancestral village, Koshkeldy, in Chechnya's Gudermes district.""          About 150 people attended a vigil that was held in Moscow's Pushkin Square about nine days after the murder, following Russian Orthodox tradition. After all but twenty people had left, police arrested the organizer of the event, Viktor Sotirko of Memorial. He was held for two hours and charged with disturbing the peace. Police said only 30 people had been sanctioned to attend the event, but far more had shown up.          The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, stationed in Moscow, reported that Estemirova was engaged in ""very important and dangerous work"", investigating hundreds of cases of alleged kidnappings, torture and extrajudicial killings by Russian government troops or paramilitaries in Chechnya.          Russian President Dmitri Medvedev expressed ""outrage"" at the murder and ordered a top-level investigation. Speaking in Germany at the time of her funeral, he paid tribute to her and again pledged a thorough investigation. He said it was ""obvious"" to him that her murder was linked to her professional work.          Memorial claimed that ""state terror"" was to blame, calling the killing an ""extrajudicial execution"" by government-backed death squads. Memorial's chairman Oleg Orlov said that Ramzan Kadyrov threatened Natalya and that Russian president Medvedev was content with Kadyrov being a murderer. Orlov said in a statement: ""I know, I am sure who is guilty of Natalya Estemirova's murder, we all know him. His name is Ramzan Kadyrov."" According to Orlov, shortly before the murder Kadyrov made an open threat to her by saying: ""Yes, my hands are up to the elbows in blood. And I am not ashamed of that. I killed and will kill bad people"". Kadyrov denied any involvement and promised to investigate the killing personally. He condemned the killers, saying they ""must be punished as the cruelest of criminals"". It was later reported that in response to Orlov's accusation, Kadyrov would be suing the rights group for defamation, and would target Orlov personally in the complaint. Nurdi Nukhazhiyev, Chechen human rights ombudsman, called Orlov's accusation ""groundless and ludicrous"".           In January 2010, Ramzan Kadyrov, in an interview to ""Russia Today"" accused Berezovsky of murdering Estemirova. Despite expressing confidence that the crime will be solved, he acknowledged that as of that date it had not:           Medvedev responded to the accusation, saying the timing of the crime, a day before his trip to Germany for talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel, was a provocation intended to give rise to ""the most primitive theories and those most disagreeable to the state"". Merkel said she expressed her ""outrage"" over the killing in her talks with Medvedev ""and made clear that everything must be done to solve this crime"".          United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said he was ""appalled and saddened"" by Estemirova's murder. UN spokeswoman Marie Okabe stated that Ban ""urges the Russian authorities to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation in order to bring the perpetrators of this heinous killing to justice, and by doing so, to send a strong and unambiguous message that the targeting of human rights activists will not be tolerated"". The chairman of the EPP Group in the European Parliament, Joseph Daul, condemned the perpetrators and called for an investigation and bringing the perpetrators to trial.          In February 2010 an anonymous source in the Russian law enforcement bodies claimed that investigators knew Estemirova's murderer. Yet, the murderer wasn't caught, nor was the organizer of the crime identified.           Journalists of ""Novaya Gazeta"" together with the human rights society Memorial and the International Federation for Human Rights are conducting their own investigation, they also monitor the official investigation. According to them, the main version of the official investigators is that Estemirova was murdered by rebel Alkhazur Bashayev, a member of a jamaat in the Chechen village of Shalazhy (Шалажи). On 15 January 2010 during a search in the house of Alkhazur Bashayev, the investigators found a large stockpile of weapons, including the handgun that was used to murder Estemirova and a counterfeit police id with a photograph of Bashayev. On 7 February 2010, they found an abandoned VAZ-2107 car that was identified as the car bought by Bashayev. In the car they found a suppressor made of the same material as the fragment found on the crime scene. The plant fragments found on the suspension on the car were similar to the plants found at the crime scene.           According to the official investigators, Bashayev was trying to smear Kadyrov and the leadership of the Chechen Republic, and he might also have been upset by publications by Estemirova where she had alleged that Bashayev had been recruiting for the rebel group without any opposition of the officials and suggested that he might be an agent for Kadyrovtsy.          According to the official information, on 13 November 2009, Bashayev was killed by an air strike during a special operation led by Adam Delimkhanov.

Written during a time of rapid increase in life expectancy (at the time of its publication American life expectancy at birth was around 60 and climbing fast, from being only ""at"" age 40 fifty years before), it was very popular and influential. It was the #1 bestselling non-fiction book in the United States in 1933, and #2 in 1934, according to ""Publishers Weekly"".          Although Pitkin did not necessarily coin the phrase ""life begins at forty"", the success of his book entered it into general circulation, such that after 1932 it became an American catchphrase for the remainder of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first (it is the title of a 1935 Will Rogers movie, a 1937 song sung by Sophie Tucker, a 1980 John Lennon song, two television series (in 1978 in Britain and 2003 in Hong Kong), and several novels and other books).          More an extended essay and exhortation than a detailed self-help book in the modern sense, the general thrust of the book is that, given the current conditions of the world, one could look forward to many years of fulfilling and happy existence after age 40, provided that one maintained the proper positive attitude.","['1932 books', 'Self-help books']"

45229464,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45229464,San Pedro Cemetery Museum,"The San Pedro Cemetery Museum is a cemetery and museum located in Medellín, Colombia. It was constructed in 1842, named a museum in 1998, and declared a National Monument of Colombia in 1999. This place is an integral part of the cultural and architectural heritage of the city. It is administered by the Foundation of San Pedro Cemetery.          Funerary monuments are erected here in memory of prominent figures in the history of Colombia. Although it falls under the category of funerary sculptures and architecture, the space has begun to emerge as a new venue for artistic dissemination. Local and national collections of art are preserved there and, in full moon nights, concerts, shows, storytelling, theater, and dance performances are held.          The Cemetery San Pedro was founded in 1842, when the small town of La Candelaria (present-day Medellín) had 9000 inhabitants and only 16 years had passed since it became the new capital of Antioquia. This time was characterized by great advances in the town, such as a population increase and strengthening of major economic groups, wars fought between political parties, colonization of western Colombia, the consolidation of trade, the birth of the industry, railroad building and navigating the Magdalena River. Specifically, the cemetery was founded on July 8, 1842 under the initiative of Pedro Uribe Restrepo, who called a meeting of important families of the Villa de la Candelaria. They agreed to the founding of a new cemetery, seeing the lack of one worth their families, since the Cemetery of San Lorenzo, which was founded in January 1828, was the only one there and, therefore, was too small to continue providing the service to the families of Medellín.          The partners decided to buy land in the ridge of El Llano (today Bolivar Street). The lot was 125 yards long by 200 yards wide and on 30 September 1842 the deed of purchase was signed. The cemetery was called the ""New Cemetery, of Individuals"" or ""of San Vicente of Paul"" until 1871, when it changed names to San Pedro Cemetery. Because it was founded by members of the commercial, political, and intellectual elite of the time, it began to be called the cemetery of rich or ""white city"", for the many mausoleums and sculptures made of Carrara marble, most brought from Pietrasanta, Italy.          With the growth and progress of Medellín, the cemetery needed to make additions and alterations to improve service, whereby the surrounding land was acquired. The first gallery built was that of San Lorenzo on the southwest side of the main courtyard and from this model was consolidated throughout the territory with similar constructions for the entire set. In the 1920s, various projects were started. During this time, engineer and Belgian architect Agustín Goovaerts created the cemetery's chapel in 1925 and a monument for Camilo Restrepo in 1926.          Between 1996 and 1997 an evaluation and investigation was conducted, the result of this evaluation defined the need to seek protective mechanisms for a work that had a high degree of deterioration. In 1997 the institution Colcultura (today known as the Ministry of Culture) was solicited to declare the Cemetery of San Pedro as a National Monument of Colombia.          The following is a select list of famous people interred in the cemetery: Fidel Cano, Mariano Ospina Rodríguez, Pedro Nel Ospina, Luciano Restrepo Escobar, Pedro Justo Berrío, Carlos Coriolano Amador, José María Sierra, Alejandro Ángel, Efe Gómez, Luis López de Mesa, Félix de Bedout Moreno, Manuel Uribe Ángel, Pedro Estrado, Luis Eduardo Yepes, Jorge Isaacs, Francisco Antonio Cano, Marco Tobón Mejía, Bernardo Vieco Ortiz, Jorge Marín Vieco, Pedro Nel Gómez, Constantino Carvajal, Rafael Sáenz,","['National Monuments of Colombia', 'Cemeteries in Colombia', 'Museums in Medell\xc3\xadn']"

10632302,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10632302,Popular music in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,"SFR Yugoslav pop and rock scene includes the pop and rock music of the former SFR Yugoslavia, including all their genres and subgenres. The scene included the constituent republics: SR Slovenia, SR Croatia, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SR Montenegro, SR Macedonia and SR Serbia and its subunits: SAP Vojvodina and SAP Kosovo. The pop and rock scene was a part of the general Music of Yugoslavia, which also included folk, classical music, jazz etc. Within Yugoslavia and internationally, the phrase ""ex Yugoslav Pop and Rock"" both formally and informally always refers to the SFRY period only, not including Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1992–2003).          The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was not an Eastern Bloc country, but a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement and as such, it was far more open to western influences compared to the other socialist states. The western-influenced pop and rock music was socially accepted, the Yugoslav pop and rock music scene was well developed and covered in the media, which included numerous magazines, radio and TV shows. Numerous artists even played for president Josip Broz Tito himself, notably Bijelo Dugme, Zdravko Čolić and Rani Mraz. SFR Yugoslavia was the only Socialist country which was taking part in the Eurovision Song Contest. It joined in 1961 even before some Western and NATO nations such as Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Turkey, which joined in 1964, 1965, 1974 and 1975 respectively. Unlike the citizens of other Socialist countries, Yugoslavs enjoyed freedom of travel and had an easy access to Western popular culture.          One of the first stars in the former Socialist Yugoslavia and one of its first internationally acclaimed artists, was the traditional pop singer Ivo Robić from Croatia, who emerged in the Yugoslav music scene in the late 1940s. Later, he went abroad, where he made a successful international career. He was the original performer of the famous ""Strangers in the Night"" song by Bert Kaempfert, predating Frank Sinatra who recorded his version later in 1966.          Robić closely cooperated with Kaempfert throughout most of his career. In the early 1960s, after seeing a promising young act from England performing at the Top Ten Club in Hamburg, Robić convinced Kaempfert, who was Polydor's agent, to help those youngsters in their career. Kaempfert accepted and thanks to him the group was hired to record together with the then popular Tony Sheridan. The young group was The Beatles. Those were their first commercial recordings ever, including ""My Bonnie"", ""Ain't She Sweet"" and ""Cry for a Shadow"". That album was released in numerous versions such as ""In the Beginning (Circa 1960)"", ""The Beatles' First"" and ""Beatles Bop - Hamburg Days"".          The rock and roll scene in Yugoslavia started to emerge in the 1950s influenced by the classical rock and roll and rockabilly acts such as Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Bill Haley, Carl Perkins, Buddy Holly and others. Many young people started to play this new ""electric music"", as they called it, naming themselves ""električari"", but one of the first who rose to prominence was the guitarist Mile Lojpur from Belgrade (born in Zrenjanin in 1930). He was tributed by many musicians later, notably by Nikola Čuturilo. Other eminent act that started in the 1950s rock 'n' roll scene was Karlo Metikoš from Zagreb, who after moving to Paris started an international career under the pseudonym Matt Collins. He recorded for Philips Records and had an opportunity to meet legends such as Jerry Lee Lewis and Paul Anka.          A notable singer who emerged in the late 1950s was Đorđe Marjanović, who became the first Yugoslav megastar.          The beginning of the 1960s saw the emergence of numerous bands, many of them initially inspired by the then-popular Cliff Richard and The Shadows: Bijele Strijele and Siluete, formed in 1961; the Zagreb-based Crveni Koralji and Belgrade's Zlatni Dečaci in 1962; in 1963 two other important Belgrade bands were formed, Samonikli and Crni Biseri, the latter featuring Vlada Janković-Džet, a prominent Yugoslav musician, who got his nickname after Jet Harris. The Zagreb-based Delfini were also formed the same year. After the British invasion, many of these bands later moved on to British rhythm and blues. In Skopje, a popular 1960s rock 'n' roll group was formed named Bisbez who were considered ""The Macedonian Beatles"". They were formed by merging two already existing bands Biseri and Bezimeni.          The 1960s also saw the expansion of Beatlemania. Many new bands formed influenced by The Beatles or by the Rolling Stones, both of whom had large fanbases in SFR Yugoslavia. There were frequent arguments between the fans of both groups, though not necessarily violent. One of the important source of information for the youths to stay up-to-date with the rock music developments around the world was Radio Luxembourg. Certain British artists held concerts in Yugoslavia (e.g. The Searchers, The Hollies) and also Yugoslav artists performed around Europe, especially neighbouring Italy and Austria. On the border with Italy, several Yugoslav-Italian beat music festivals took place.          In the mid-1960s many bands such as Džentlmeni, Roboti and the reformed Siluete were influenced by the rhythm and blues artists, while others were more pop oriented. Mod oriented bands also emerged. The most popular foreign bands were The Animals, The Byrds, The Monkees The Kinks, The Who, Manfred Mann and others. The garage rock sound (also labeled as ""1960s Punk"") was also popular. The charismatic frontman of Siluete, Zoran Miščević, became an idol of the new generation and a sex symbol. The band had a bad reputation for causing scandals and riots at their concerts. Their main rivals were the group Elipse, which, after getting a new vocalist, the African student from Congo Edi Dekeng, went on to play soul music.          The prominent Croatian singer Tereza Kesovija represented Monaco at the Eurovision Song Contest 1966.          One of the most eminent and influential former Yugoslav group formed in the 1960s was Indexi. They were formed in Sarajevo in 1962. In their early beginnings they were notably influenced by The Shadows and later by The Beatles. Along with the numerous evergreen songs they wrote featuring Davorin Popović's trademark nasal voice, they also covered the famous Beatles song ""Nowhere Man"". In some of their songs they also experimented with the sound in a similar way to ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"". Indexi gradually moved to a more psychedelic sound, with more complex guitar and keyboard solos adding occasional folk and even classical music elements. One of the band's notable members Kornelije Kovač, left Indeksi to form another legendary band, Korni Grupa, in Belgrade in 1968.          As the end of the 1960s was approaching, the hippie movement expanded around the world as well as in SFR Yugoslavia. Notable group was the Croatian-based Grupa 220, which during a certain period featured Piko Stančić. Later he rose to one of the most important musicians, producers and arrangers in the whole former Yugoslav scene.          Under influences such as Bob Dylan and Joan Baez, many young people embraced the acoustic sound and thus were called ""akustičari"" contrary to""električari""          ,electricians. Prominent acoustic artist was Ivica Percl, formerly of Roboti. He was an acoustic musician and peace activist playing guitar and harmonica influenced by Bob Dylan and Donovan.          The year of 1968 was marked by youth protests around the world including massive student demonstrations in many cities all over SFR Yugoslavia.          Another popular act at the time was the group Ambasadori. One of the members of both Ambasadori and Korni Grupa was Zdravko Čolić, who went solo later and was acclaimed as the biggest pop star in the former Yugoslavia. The most notable female vocalist was Josipa Lisac who still enjoys huge popularity across the former SFR Yugoslavia. Boba Stefanović was one of the most prominent Yugoslav male solo vocalists.          The Hippie era was marked by the famous musical ""Hair"". Numerous subsequent productions were staged around the world since its American debut in 1967, for example in Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland, Brazil, Argentina, Israel and Japan. The Yugoslav production was the first staged in a Socialist state, and it was highly praised by the ""Hair""'s original authors Gerome Ragni and James Rado, who were travelling from one country to another to watch each of the performances. As Ragni said, they found the Belgrade show ""so beautiful, so spontaneous that we had to go right on the stage to share their enthusiasm"". While being in Belgrade he also added ""There exist no middle-class prejudices here"".          Many pop music festivals existed across SFR Yugoslavia including the Split Festival, Opatija Festival, Beogradsko proleće in Belgrade, Skopje Fest, Vaš šlager sezone in Sarajevo, and later also Makfest in Štip was established. The family-friendly pop music played at those festivals was comparable to older Eurovision Song Contests, the German schlager genre, the Italian Sanremo Music Festival or the adult oriented pop music category. The specific Dalmatian pop sound featuring local folk elements performed at festivals held along the touristy Adriatic coast was very popular and some of its most notable exponents were Oliver Dragojević and Mišo Kovač.          The 1970s were marked by rock genres such as hard rock, progressive rock, jazz rock, art rock, glam rock, folk rock, symphonic rock, blues rock and boogie rock. In that period, some of the greatest Yugoslav stadium rock bands emerged: YU grupa, Time, Smak, Parni valjak, Atomsko Sklonište, Leb i Sol, Teška industrija and Galija.          In 1974 one of greatest rock groups ever formed in SFR Yugoslavia came to prominence, the Sarajevo based Bijelo Dugme with its first singer Željko Bebek.          Many foreign pop and rock stars visited Yugoslavia, including the Deep Purple concerts in Zagreb and Belgrade in 1975 with the local support acts Hobo and Smak in each of the cities respectively, and the Rolling Stones concert in Zagreb in 1976.          Several rock music festivals existed of which ""BOOM"" was one of the most popular. A rock music event that marked the decade, but also the Yugoslav rock history in general, was the Bijelo Dugme's concert at Hajdučka česma in Košutnjak Park in Belgrade on August 22, 1977, which was attended by around 80,000 people. (Parts of) the recorded material were released on the live album ""Koncert kod Hajdučke česme"".          1975 saw the emergence of a very influential act, Buldožer from Slovenia, noted for its experimental rock, which was a reaction pointed against the musical scene of the time.          The Yugoslav scene also featured several notable singer-songwriters, who emphasized their poetry over music, and usually performed accompanying themselves by an acoustic guitar or piano. Some of them were inspired by the French chanson or folk rock. One of the first critically acclaimed singer-songwriters was the Croatian artist Arsen Dedić who started his career in the 1960s and is still popular in his homeland and around the former Yugoslav countries, especially among the older generation. Another important author was also Đorđe Balašević from Novi Sad. He started his music career in the 1970s as a member of Žetva and Rani Mraz, before beginning a very successful solo career that continues up to the present. Despite being into acoustic rock initially, later he often used various elements of pop and rock often spiced up either with typical Vojvodinian humour or a ballad type of melancholy. A notable female artist in this category was Jadranka Stojaković from Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. She was an author of the main music theme for the 1984 Winter Olympics held in Sarajevo. Since 1988, she resides in Japan. An artist notable for socially engaged lyrics was Marko Brecelj, formerly a member of Buldožer.          The disco craze spread around the world in the 1970s conquering Yugoslavia as well. Similarly to the disco movie ""Saturday Night Fever"", Zdravko Čolić became a sort of ""Yugoslav John Travolta"" dancing in stadiums across the country, dressed in a tight white suit and the then-fashionable bell-bottoms. At the legendary concert at the Belgrade stadium ""Marakana"" on September 5, 1978, about 70,000 people gathered to see him. The concert was also attended by representatives of a West German record label. Impressed by Čolić's popularity they offered him a record contract. He released the songs ""Jedina"" and ""Zagrli me"" for the Western German market and also an English language single featuring the songs ""I'm not a Robot Man"" and ""Light Me"". Čolić was offered to move to West Germany and start a career there, but he refused favouring the popularity he had at home. His song about a relationship with a posh girl ""Pusti, Pusti modu"" became a nationwide disco megahit in 1980. Despite that the disco fashion soon faded, Čolić continued his successful career as a pop music singer occasionally using folk music elements and remained popular in the former Yugoslav countries up to this day.          This era also brought in a one-hit wonder called Mirzino Jato, labeled by the media as kitschy euro disco band obviously influenced by Boney M., who were quite popular in Yugoslavia, especially after their only male member Bobby Farrell married a girl from Skopje's predominantly Romani inhabited municipality Šuto Orizari. Mirzino Jato's style encompassed the deep, subwoofer shaking voice of Sarajevo opera and classical choir singer Mirza Alijagić and the three sexy back vocalists called ""Jato"" (trans. ""Flock""). Music was written and produced by Divlje Jagode guitarist Sead Lipovača, while the author of most lyrics was Marina Tucaković, who later became famous writing lyrics for other musical styles. Despite their huge popularity at the time, Mirzino Jato never got past the first album. Its only considerable hit was ""Apsolutno tvoj"".          One of the best known dance songs in this period was also the Dado Topić's opening track of the 1979 film ""Nacionalna klasa"" starring Dragan Nikolić as Floyd, the fanatic car racer.          Gordi were one of the first Yugoslav heavy metal bands and are considered one of the pioneers of classic heavy metal in Yugoslavia. Hard rock group Riblja Čorba, known for their provocative social-related lyrics and controversial political attitudes of the band's frontman Bora Đorđević was one of the most important groups of the Yugoslav and Serbian rock in general. Riblja Čorba drummer Vicko Milatović formed heavy metal band Warriors, which later moved to Canada and recorded an album for the foreign market. The eminent heavy metal group Divlje Jagode from Bihać, led by guitarist Sead ""Zele"" Lipovača started a short-lasting international career in 1987 under the name Wild Strawberries. Another notable Bosnian hard rock group was Vatreni Poljubac led by charismatic Milić Vukašinović, formerly a member of Bijelo Dugme. Other notable hard rock and heavy metal bands include Generacija 5, Rok Mašina, Kerber and Griva from Serbia; Osmi Putnik (whose frontman Zlatan Stipišić Gibonni, later started a successful pop music career) and Crna Udovica (later changed their name to Big Blue) from Croatia; Pomaranča from Slovenia, and others. Yugoslav glam metal scene featured few acts, most notable being Karizma and Osvajači.          The Yugoslav punk rock scene emerged in the late 1970s, influenced by the first wave of punk rock bands from the United Kingdom and United States, such as Sex Pistols and The Clash and others, but also the proto-punk bands such as MC5, The Stooges and New York Dolls. The DIY punkzine scene also started to develop. The Yugoslav punk bands were the first punk bands ever formed in a socialist state. Some of the first ones were formed in SR Slovenia and SR Croatia: Pankrti from Ljubljana (formed in 1977) and Paraf from Rijeka (depending on the source, formed in 1976 or 1977). The Slovenian and Croatian scene of that period is featured in the compilation album ""Novi Punk Val"", compiled by Igor Vidmar. Late 1970s-early 1980s Belgrade scene included: Urbana Gerila, Radnička Kontrola and many others. This generation of bands was included on the ""Artistička Radna Akcija"" compilation. Pekinška Patka was a cult band coming from Novi Sad. Some of the notable punk bands in SR Macedonia included: Fol Jazik, arguably the first punk band in Skopje, formed in 1978; Afektiven naboj from Struga formed in 1979 feat. Goran Trajkoski; Other notable acts from Skopje included Badmingtons and Saraceni, both led by Vladimir Petrovski Karter. In Sarajevo, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, the following artists emerged: Ozbiljno Pitanje (which later evolved into the pop-rock star band Crvena Jabuka), Ševa (which later evolved into Bombaj Štampa led by the charismatic Branko Đurić), and the cult band Zabranjeno Pušenje. These Sarajevian bands later formed the punk-inspired New Primitives movement, an important phenomenon in the former Yugoslav culture.          In the late 1970s, some punk bands were affiliated with the new wave music scene, and were labeled as both punk rock and new wave. During a certain period, the term ""new wave music"" was interchangeable with ""punk"".          The end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s saw the emergence of various subgenres of punk rock, such as streetpunk and Oi!. Later came hardcore punk, followed by various extreme styles such as crust punk, crossover thrash all the way to grindcore. Notable hardcore punk acts during the 1980s included: Niet, Patareni, KBO! and others. A notable mainstream pop punk band was Psihomodo Pop from Croatia (heavily influenced by The Ramones). Many eminent foreign punk bands played concerts around former Yugoslavia including: The Ruts, Siouxsie and the Banshees, U.K. Subs, Angelic Upstarts, The Exploited and The Anti-Nowhere League. In 1983 The Anti-Nowhere League released their album ""Live in Yugoslavia"", while Angelic Upstarts released a live album with the same title in 1985. Beside musicians, the Yugoslav punk subculture also included punk writers and artists, with Ivan Glišić from Šabac being one of the notable ones.          The new wave music scene emerged in the late 1970s and had a significant impact on Yugoslav culture. As its counterparts – the British and the US new wave music scenes, from which the main influences came from, the Yugoslav new wave scene was also closely related to Punk rock, Ska, Reggae, 2 Tone, Power pop, Mod Revival etc. The new wave was especially advocated by the music magazines ""Polet"" from Zagreb and Džuboks from Belgrade, and by the TV show Rokenroler, which was famous for its artistic music videos.          Important bands of the Yugoslav new wave are: Prljavo kazalište, Novi fosili, Šarlo Akrobata, Idoli, Azra, Električni orgazam, Haustor, Film, Laboratorija Zvuka, Lačni Franz, Cilindar and many others. This period in the former Yugoslav music is considered a ""Golden age"". All of these artists still have status of cult bands.          Symbols of the Yugoslav new wave era are the compilation albums ""Paket aranžman"", ""Novi Punk Val"", ""Artistička Radna Akcija"" and especially movies ""Davitelj protiv davitelja"" (starring Idoli member Srđan Šaper) and ""Dečko koji obećava"" (starring Aleksandar Berček and featuring appearances by members of Šarlo Akrobata and Idoli).          An important rockumentary covering this period is ""Sretno dijete"".          As the new wave perished in the beginning of the 1980s, some of the bands split or took different musical directions. The period around 1982 is considered especially crucial concerning the decline of the new wave in Yugoslavia, but also around the world. Many new important bands formed in 1982 after the new wave faded: Dušan Kojić-Koja, the former bass player of Šarlo Akrobata formed the legendary group Disciplina Kičme (a unique noisy mix of punk rock, funk, jazz fusion and many other styles). The band later rose to international prominence and appeared on MTV. Zoran Kostić-Cane, the former vocalist of Radnička Kontrola, formed the furious garage punk group Partibrejkers and achieved huge success. Idoli, Prljavo Kazalište and Film (the latter under the moniker ""Jura Stublić i Film"") became pop-rock and all of them respectively achieved great mainstream success; The cult band Azra gradually moved on to a more conventional rock sound with occasional use of folk rock. Johnny Štulić's poetic trademarks were still notable throughout their lyrics. Električni Orgazam went through a psychedelic phase and later became a successful mainstream rock band inspired mostly by the 1960s sound.          One of the most prominent mainstream dance pop acts during the decade, especially in the early 1980s, was Oliver Mandić. He used transvestite elements in his stage and video performances long before Boy George emerged. His music utilized lots of funk dance music. The national Radio-Television Belgrade filmed the famous TV show featuring a collection of his music videos called ""Beograd noću"" (""Belgrade by Night"") directed by Stanko Crnobrnja. The ambitiously avantgarde program won Rose d'Or award at the 1981 Montreux TV festival. Mandić's controversial image in the show, created by the conceptual artist Kosta Bunuševac, raised quite a public furor due to the singer's cross-dressing and aggressive makeup.          A former Riblja čorba member, Momčilo Bajagić Bajaga formed one of the most popular ex-Yugoslav acts ever, Bajaga i Instruktori. Later, Dejan Cukić, one of the members of Instruktori left the band and started a successful solo career.          Family-friendly pop acts during the 1980s were Novi Fosili and the Split based group Magazin, both featuring female vocalists.          1983 was marked by Danijel Popović, the Yugoslav performer at the Eurovision Song Contest in Munich. He instantly became a nationwide pop star, but was also acclaimed around Europe. West German and Swedish artists released cover versions of his hit ""Džuli"".          In the following year, at the national ESC pre-selection in Skopje, Dado Topić performed a duet with Slađana Milošević, known for her extravagant style comparable to that of Nina Hagen. Although their song ""Princeza"" did not win, it remained an evergreen pop ballad. Another notable duet was the song ""Jabuke i vino"" by Željko Bebek and Zana Nimani.          Zana Nimani was a notable artist from the Albanian minority, she was a frontress of the band Zana from Belgrade and later started a solo career.          The most popular TV show during the decade was ""Hit meseca"" (""Hit of the Month"") which was a sort of Yugoslav ""Top of the Pops"". The host of the show was Dubravka ""Duca"" Marković. A popular magazine among the youths was ""ITD"", which also had a version called ""Super ITD"" in a bigger format. The most prominent rock music magazines were ""Rock"" and ""Džuboks"".          Musical genres such as Post-punk, Gothic rock, Darkwave, New Romantic and Synthpop were already expanded in SFR Yugoslavia during the early 1980s, and especially at the end of 1980,s because of coming of new technologies such as Video recorders and Satellite Television in many homes in SFR Yugoslavia.          The former punks Pekinška Patka moved to post-punk and darkwave on their second, less acclaimed album ""Strah od monotonije"" released in 1981 and soon disbanded. Another legendary band, Paraf, moved from their initial punk rock phase and released their psychedelic album ""Izleti"" in 1982 with elements of post-punk and gothic rock. Električni Orgazam had a notable psychedelic phase, during which, they released their album ""Lišće prekriva Lisabon"" in 1982.          Milan Mladenović, formerly a guitarist of Šarlo Akrobata, in that same 1982 formed the cult band Ekatarina Velika, initially named Katarina II. The band is remembered for its darker poetic post-punk sound and its intellectual attitude. Some of its members included the bass guitar player Bojan Pečar, formerly a member of Via Talas and the drummer Srđan Todorović, who later rose to internationally acclaimed film actor. Margita Stefanović-Magi, the keyboard player, and Milan, the frontman both rose to a status of ""alternative celebrities"". Later, both died.          Notable art rock groups included the arty and extravagant Dorian Gray and Boa, both from Zagreb. The former, named after Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray, formed in 1982, influenced by Roxy Music and Japan. It was led by Massimo Savić, later a successful pop singer. BOA formed in the 1970s, influenced by Yes, King Crimson and Genesis, but later turned to New Romantic. In 1990, it performed as David Bowie's opening act at Maksimir stadium.          During the New Romantic era popularized around the world by Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet, prominent acts in Yugoslavia were the aforementioned Zagreb based group Boa and Jakarta from Belgrade.          Notable synthpop artists in the former Yugoslavia included: Beograd, formed in 1981, named after their hometown Belgrade; Videosex from Ljubljana, Slovenia, led by their charismatic frontress Anja Rupel; the duo Denis & Denis from Croatia featuring the sex-symbol Marina Perazić, who later started a solo career, and her boyfriend Davor Tolja; the humorous bunch Laki Pingvini and a similar act named D' Boys (pronounced as ""The Boys"") led by Peđa D' Boy, formerly a vocalist of the West German rock band Jane. In Macedonia, a notable synthesizer-led act was the group Bastion which featured the now internationally acclaimed electronic musician Kiril Džajkovski on electronic keyboards and Milcho Manchevski as a lyrics writer. Many Yugoslav artists in this period were already experimenting with the use of personal computers in creating of their music. The cover of the single ""Neka ti se dese prave stvari"" / ""Ne zovi to ljubavlju"" by the Belgrade-based group Data featured the then popular Commodore 64.          The New Primitivism was an urban subcultural movement in Sarajevo in the early 1980s. Some of projects that came from the New Primitives were the band Zabranjeno Pušenje, the ""Top lista nadrealista"" TV and radio show, the legendary group Elvis J. Kurtović & His Meteors, Bombaj Štampa and others. Its creators include Elvis J. Kurtović, dr. Nele Karajlić, mr. Sejo Sexon, Bombaj Stampa (featuring actor/director Branko Đurić — Đuro), Boris Šiber, Zenit Đozić from Sarajevo neighbourhood of Koševo. The famous film director Emir Kusturica was an associate and friend of the crew.          The fresh spirit that the group left in the urban Bosnian culture and a quite new way of expression, flooding directly from street subculture, attracted significant popularity and made it one of monuments of modern Bosnian culture.          The discourse of New Primitivism was primarily humorous, based on the spirit of Bosnian ordinary people from the cultural underground. They introduced the jargon, rich in Turcisms, of Sarajevo ""mahalas"" (suburban neighborhoods) into the official musical and TV scene. Most of their songs and sketches involve stories about small people – coalmine workers, petty criminals, provincial girls etc. - put in unusual or even absurd situations. There are comparisons between ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" show and New Primitives methods, as they share the form of short sketches and utilize absurdity as means to illicit laughs from the audience.          The name of the movement arguably came as a reaction to two then-actual movements: New Romantic in global pop music and Slovenian Neue Slowenische Kunst (NSK).          In the late 1984 Bob Geldof and Midge Ure organized the famous famine relief campaign named Band Aid, which continued throughout 1985 until its finale – the historical Live Aid concert on 13 July 1985. The concert was broadcast worldwide including SFR Yugoslavia. Beside ""Do They Know it's Christmas?"" and USA for Africa projects from the UK and USA respectively, plenty of other countries also joined in. For example: Canada, West Germany, Austria, Norway etc. The SFR Yugoslav pop and rock elite also joined Geldof's campaign and formed a Yugoslav Band Aid under the name YU Rock Misija. The group included Oliver Mandić, Željko Bebek, Momčilo Bajagić, Slađana Milošević, Jura Stublić, Dado Topić, Zdravko Čolić, Izolda Barudžija, Snežana Mišković, Alen Islamović, Sead Lipovača, Dejan Cukić, Doris Dragović, Anja Rupel, Srđan Šaper, Vladimir Divljan, Peđa D' Boy, Zoran Predin and other eminent musicians. They recorded the Yugoslav Band Aid song ""Za million godina"" (""For a Million Years"") written by former Generacija 5 leader Dragan Ilić and Mladen Popović. The guitar solo in the song is played by Vlatko Stefanovski. The song was released as a single. Also a corresponding video was filmed. Bora Đorđević and Goran Bregović, leaders of Riblja Čorba and Bijelo Dugme were not credited on the record's back cover, however they appeared in a TV performance of the song. At the end of the campaign, the Yugoslav musicians played a big 8 hour stadium concert on June 15, 1985 in Belgrade. The video for ""Za million godina"" was played on many TV stations worldwide and also, on July 13 at the Wembley Stadium on large video screens during a video interlude. It is included, though not completely, in the ""Overseas contributors"" section in the official ""Live Aid DVD"" that was released in the 2004 by Warner Music Group.          Sarajevo developed a distinguishable pop and rock sound, often (but not necessarily) featuring Bosnian folk music elements, which became popular across the whole Yugoslav federation. It was the birthplace of one of the top Yugoslav rock bands Bijelo Dugme and the pop star Zdravko Čolić.          The scene began to develop in the 1960s with groups such as Indexi, Pro Arte and singer/songwriter Kemal Monteno. It continued into the 1970s with Ambasadori, Bijelo dugme and Vatreni poljubac, while the 1980s brought artists such as Plavi Orkestar, Crvena Jabuka, Hari Mata Hari, Dino Merlin, Valentino, Regina, Bolero and Gino Banana.          Sarajevo was also the home of the authentic punk-influenced subculture known as the New Primitives, which developed in the early 1980s and was brought into the mainstream by artists such as Zabranjeno Pušenje, Elvis J. Kurtović & His Meteors, Bombaj Štampa and the radio and TV comedy show Top Lista Nadrealista.          Notable industrial music acts in Yugoslavia were Laibach from Ljubljana, Autopsia from Ruma and SCH from Sarajevo.          The Yugoslav scene also included numerous neo-rockabilly, psychobilly and retro-rock and roll acts.          A noted artist was controversial Velibor ""Bora"" Miljković, better known as Toni Montano, nicknamed after Tony Montana, the main character of the movie Scarface. He was a former vocalist of the punk rock group Radost Evrope, ironically named after the famous international children's music festival ""Joy of Europe"" held annually in Belgrade. Toni often stirred controversy in his interviews and frequently attacked other musicians, like Ekaterina Velika and such, whom he considered pseudointellectuals who alienated themselves from the ""street"", where, according to him, the real rock music should emerge from. He arrogantly proclaimed himself a ""real rock star"" whose time is yet to come. However, he never really managed to achieve the success of his adversaries, who never bothered much with him anyway. His albums often included cover versions of famous punk rock tracks, such as the Sex Pistols' ""Friggin' in the Riggin'"" and ""Lonely Boy"". Espousing an macho rocker attitude and image, Toni's songs often featured sexist lyrics.          On the other hand, the group Đavoli from Split led by Nenad ""Neno"" Belan were a softer retro-rock 'n' roll act, they released several summer hits and also twist or surf music influenced tracks. Some of its members also had punk rock background.          The rockabilly group Fantomi was another act in Croatia, while in Serbia the group called Vampiri emerged with their trademark doo-wop style of singing and performed as a support act of the internationally acclaimed retro jazzy pop group Vaya Con Dios at their concert in Belgrade.          In Slovenia, the cult avant-garde band Laibach emerged in 1980. Experimenting with various styles such as industrial, martial and neo-classical music they rose to international prominence and influenced acts such as the famous group Rammstein for instance. They appeared on MTV with their cover version of ""Across the Universe"" by The Beatles, featuring a guest-appearance by Anja Rupel. One of the groups connected with NSK were Abbildungen Variete from Maribor.          The most notable electronic body music act was Borghesia, from Ljubljana, Slovenia.          While Slovenia had the Neue Slowenische Kunst movement, in Macedonia, the collective Makedonska Streljba was formed. The Macedonian darkwave and gothic rock scene featured some of the most prominent Macedonian acts ever, such as Mizar, Arhangel and Padot na Vizantija, the latter featuring Goran Trajkoski.          The Extreme metal music scene across SFR Yugoslavia was also developed. It included various thrash metal, speed metal and death metal acts. A festival called ""Hard Metal"" was taking place in Belgrade and also a magazine with the same name was published.          Notable acts included speed metal band Bombarder (initially formed in Sarajevo, later moved to Belgrade), Bloodbath (not to be confused with the Swedish band Bloodbath), Heller (the pioneers of Yugoslav thrash metal) and others. The thrash metal band Sanatorium was formed in Skopje in 1987. During its 20 years of existence, it shared stage with many prominent international stars such as Motörhead, Halford, Soulfly and others.          Many rap music artists emerged in SFR Yugoslavia throughout the 1980s. Breakdance groups also existed especially in the first half of the 1980s. A prominent breakdance rap act was The Master Scratch Band. They have released some works for Jugoton in 1984 including the track ""Break War"" featuring ""Hit Meseca"" host Dubravka ""Duca"" Marković. Disciplina Kičme also used rap music elements, though in their own specific way, always mixed with numerous other styles.          But there was an artist who utilized rap music in a very distinguishable manner. In the late 1980s, a charismatic musician of Montenegrin origin came into nationwide prominence: Rambo Amadeus. His pseudonym as well as his music encompassed an intellectual attitude on one side, but also a distinguishable Balkan-flavoured humour and macho camp on the other. He often, if not always used rap music combined with folk music parody and political and social satire, although he doesn't fit into the conventional rap music category because he went beyond the style. He is also famous for coining the term ""turbo folk"", though he was one of its greatest enemies. He is still a cult personality in the ex-Yugoslav territories.          He often closely cooperated with another musician, Dino Dvornik, the son of the famous Croatian actor Boris Dvornik. Dino Dvornik was a popular funk-inspired dance-pop artist.          Two years after the group Riva won the Eurovision Song Contest in 1989 and one year after the Eurovision Song Contest 1990 took place in Zagreb, the SFR Yugoslav music scene ceased to exist with the breakup of Yugoslavia. Ironically, the 1990 winning song performed by Toto Cutugno was called (in Italian: Together in 1992) featuring the lyrics ""Together, Unite, Unite Europe!"" acclaiming the approaching European unification that took place in 1992.          Tajči became one of the last breakout pop stars in Yugoslavia, before the disintegration of the country cut her career short and she emigrated to the United States.          With the outbreak of the Yugoslav Wars many of the former Yugoslav musicians participated in anti-war activities, often being attacked by the nationalists in their countries. In 1992, the serbian rock supergroup Rimtutituki featuring members of Partibrejkers, Ekatarina Velika and Električni Orgazam released an anti-militarist song, and after the authorities forbade them to promote it with a live show, they performed on a trailer towed by a truck through the streets of Belgrade. However, others previously involved in the Yugoslav pop and rock scene embraced national chauvinism, and even saw active combat.          Notable example is the case of the song ""E, moj druže Beogradski"" (""Hey my Belgrade comrade""). Although generally seen as an emotional anti-war song pointed against the Serbian nationalism written by Jura Stublić from the Croatian group Film, at the time of its appearance it caused different reactions. Bora Đorđević, who had a cult status in the Serbian rock scene as a frontman of Riblja Čorba, soon ""replied"" with the controversial song ""E moj druže Zagrebački"" (""Hey my Zagreb comrade""), a cynical parody featuring nationalist messages.          Many Croatian pop and rock artists took part in projects such as ""Moja domovina"" and Rock za Hrvatsku during the Croatian War of Independence.          When the Bosnian War broke out, the Sarajevo based group Zabranjeno Pušenje split into two separate fractions. The latter based itself in Belgrade and received international exposure under the name No Smoking Orchestra led by Nele Karajlić, also featuring the movie director Emir Kusturica. They played with Joe Strummer and that concert footage is included in the ""Super 8 Stories"" film directed by Kusturica.          While Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia proclaimed themselves independent states, the leaderships of Serbia and Montenegro decided to form a new federal state called the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which existed from 1992 until 2003, however it was not recognized as a legal successor to the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.          The local scenes in the independent countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia continued to exist, some of them heavily suffering during the war. The music scene continued even in the shelters during the Sarajevo siege and a compilation album ""Rock under siege"" (Radio Zid Sarajevo, Stichting Popmuziek Nederland) was released in 1995.          After the end of the conflicts and especially later, after the departure of the nationalist leaders such as Slobodan Milošević and Franjo Tuđman, the former Yugoslav nations started to normalise their relations. Thus their music scenes could freely restore their former cooperation. Many of the former pop and rock stars re-emerged and toured the former Yugoslav countries: Bijelo Dugme, Leb i Sol, Crvena Jabuka, Plavi Orkestar, Massimo Savić (formerly of Dorian Gray) and Boris Novković (formerly of the group Boris i Noćna Straža), while Anja Rupel, formerly of Videosex, recorded a duet with Toše Proeski, a young Macedonian pop singer who became respected in all the former Yugoslav countries.          Following the reconciliation of Serbia and Croatia, the afforementioned Croatian musician Jura Stublić held three sold out concerts in Belgrade in 2003. Asked by the media about ""E, moj druže Zagrebački"" case, Bora Đorđević replied that ""it was just a joke"" . He also expressed approbation for the Jura Stublić's comeback to Belgrade after so many years. On the other hand, Bajaga and Đorđe Balašević had respectively made numerous concert appearances in Croatia and Bosnia.          In 2003 Igor Mirković from Croatia made the rockumentary ""Sretno dijete"" (""Happy Child"") named after a song by Prljavo Kazalište. The movie covers the early Yugoslav Punk and Yugoslav new wave scene featuring eminent artists from Zagreb, Ljubljana and Belgrade.          Many eminent former Yugoslav Pop and Rock artists composed children's music, mostly educational. The SFR Yugoslav system through its media encouraged children to practise the traditional folk music and dances, as well as to listen to pop and rock music, contrary to the kitschy ""novokomponovana narodna muzika"".","['Bosnia and Herzegovina music', 'Croatian music history', 'Culture of Vojvodina', 'Kosovar music', 'Macedonian music', 'Montenegrin music', 'Music history of Slovenia', 'Serbian music', 'Yugoslav music', 'Yugoslav rock']"

11505299,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11505299,Jon Boden,"Jon Boden is a singer, composer and musician, best known as lead singer and main arranger of Bellowhead. His first instrument is the fiddle and he is a leading proponent of ""English traditional fiddle style"" and also of ""fiddle singing"", both of which he employs in Bellowhead, in the duo Spiers & Boden, and previously as a member of Eliza Carthy’s Ratcatchers.          To date Jon Boden has been the recipient of 11 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards, more than any other musician.          Boden also fronts his own band the Remnant Kings, put together in 2009 to perform his post-apocalyptic song cycle ""Songs From The Floodplain"". He has also made contributions to many other albums as a fiddler, singer and guitarist, most notably two albums with Fay Hield & The Hurricane Party.          In 2010 he launched an ambitious project to record and deliver A Folk Song A Day on line, aiming to inspire others to build a repertoire of songs and engage in social singing. All 365 songs are now available on iTunes, Spotify and YouTube, as well as on the www.afolksongaday.com website.          Boden holds a master's degree in Musical Theatre and has worked on numerous, prestigious theatrical productions, including two plays with the Royal Shakespeare Company. In 2012 Jon was commissioned to create a stage show based on ""The Ballad Of Little Musgrave And Lady Barnard"" as part of the Benjamin Britten centenary celebrations.          As a composer Boden’s output has grown increasingly diverse, crossing over into classical, choral, dance, pop, film and television.          Boden was born in Chicago in 1977 but grew up in Winchester, England, where he attended Henry Beaufort School and Peter Symonds College. He has a BA in Medieval Studies from Durham University and a master's degree in Composition for Musical Theatre from the London College of Music.          He first started writing for the stage along with friend Chris T-T when still at school and he wrote his first musical whilst at sixth-form college. At Durham University he composed music for a number of plays and wrote a musical for his college. Whilst at Durham he met Ben Naylor who subsequently went on to become a successful theatre director and with whom Boden has worked many times since.          Alongside his performing career Boden has continued to work in theatre, most notably with the RSC.          When Jon Boden first met John Spiers in the Elm Tree pub in Oxford, Boden had little experience of folk clubs having played exclusively in pub sessions up to that point. The duo quickly established common ground and started playing together, soon establishing themselves on the live folk club circuit. They were signed by Fellside Records and their debut album ""Through & Through"" was released in 2001. The following year they toured with Eliza Carthy as part of her Ratcatchers band.          They released three further albums for Fellside, ""Bellow"" in 2003 and the companion discs, ""Songs"" and ""Tunes"" both released in 2005. Spiers & Boden then signed to Navigator Records releasing the themed ""Vagabond"" in 2008 and retrospective album ""The Works"" in 2011. The latter marked their 10th anniversary as a recording duo. They toured that year and collaborators from ""The Works"" joined them on stage, with a finale at London’s Shepherds Bush Empire featuring many guests.          In Spring 2013, Spiers & Boden undertook the innovative Backyard Songs tour, playing material relevant to each show’s locality and inviting audiences to contribute local songs, dances and folklore. Their farewell tour was announced the following year in March and May 2014 and the duo’s activities were put on hold.          Boden plays fiddle and sings lead vocal in Spiers & Boden. He was the first person to use a ""stomp box"" with English traditional music (a large wooden box containing a microphone and made to sound like a kick drum) - an idea he and Spiers borrowed from singer-songwriter Rory McCleod. Boden also plays acoustic guitar in Spiers & Boden employing a percussive finger style reminiscent of Nic Jones and Martin Simpson, but using the highly unusual tuning of CEBEBE.          The folk big band was famously conceived by Spiers & Boden whilst stuck in traffic en route to playing a gig in Essex. Initially conceived as a way to take the duo’s show to the bigger stages and festivals, John and Jon approached a wish list of friends and musical associates as well as leading session players from the world music and jazz scenes, with the idea of starting an English equivalent of the Canadian band La Bottine Souriante. Initially, Boden arranged and orchestrated an hour’s worth of material for the 10 piece band, all based on existing Spiers & Boden material, in time for Bellowhead's debut at that the 2004 Oxford Folk Festival. This was swiftly followed by recording the five track ""E.P. Onymous"", which they released independently.          Adding sousaphone player Gideon Juckes to the lineup in 2005, the band then signed to German label Westpark Music and recorded their debut full-length album ""Burlesque"". These first two releases established Boden as the principal arranger for Bellowhead. He has continued in that role, arranging around two-thirds of all the songs Bellowhead have recorded to date.          Bellowhead subsequently signed to Navigator records recording ""Matachin"" in 2008 and releasing a further two albums (""Hedonism"" in 2010 followed by ""Broadside"" in 2012, both of which, reached Silver Disc status in the UK) before signing to Island Records in 2014 and releasing ""Revival"". Upon release ""Revival"" charted at number 12 in the UK album charts.          Bellowhead have had a total of seven singles 'playlisted' by BBC Radio 2, all but one of which were arranged by Boden.          Recent tours have seen an increasing number of after show sessions, taking place in pubs local to the venues (see The Remnant Kings below).          Boden has released two solo albums. ""Painted Lady"" in 2006 released on Jon’s own Soundpost Records and ""Songs From The Floodplain"" in 2009, released by Navigator Records.          ""Painted Lady"" was produced by Jon and Ben Ivitsky and it feature 12 songs written by Boden. The record was also notable for the fact that Boden played every instrument including fiddle, octave fiddle, concertina, banjo, guitars, double bass, drums, Indian harmonium, glockenspiel, electric piano, and more unusually for a folk artist, Moog synthesiser and drum machine. Fay Hield is the only other contributor singing backing vocals on one song.          ""Songs From The Floodplain"" is a post-apocalyptic song cycle, all 12 songs written by Boden. The album was produced by Boden with Keith Angel and again Jon plays all instruments. It is a concept album based on a dystopian future after some unnamed apocalypse finds a cast of characters reverting to traditional rituals and ceremonies, while trying to make sense of their survival. A play based on the song cycle is currently in development by playwright Barney Norris.          Boden toured ""Songs From The Floodplain"" several times with The Remnant Kings. The show mixes in selections from A Folk Song A Day that loosely fit the dystopian theme, Painted Lady and other cover versions. The stage show is also notable for its use of phonograph wax cylinder players. The band is made up of multi-instrumentalists and includes Bellowhead cohorts Sam Sweeney (on fiddle, concertina, glass harmonica and drums) and Paul Sartin (on fiddle and oboe) with Rob Harbron (concertina, fiddle, banjo and guitar) and Rick Foot on bass. Live, Boden plays guitar, electric guitar, fiddle, melodeon and concertina and sings lead on all songs.          As Boden explained in this BBC Radio 3 essay, he views the prospect of a post-industrial world without gas or oil as sitting in harmony with the relevance of folk music and social singing.          Remnant King gigs were also notable for singing sessions organised after the show, either within the venues or at nearby pubs. This saw the band congregate around a table with various audience members, all singing folk songs unaccompanied.          The idea was later developed with Bellowhead with the band engaging in regular after show sessions on their tours. Boden discussed the importance of these events in this key-note speech for the English Folk Expo in 2014.          The stated aim of A Folk Song A Day was to post a traditional folksong onto the site, every day for a year. The site grew into an active blog with a lively community exploring the history and roots of the music, but was primarily intended to promote the art of social singing by giving people access to an expansive repertoire of traditional tunes.          Many of the songs were recorded with no accompaniment, but Boden used fiddle, concertina and guitar in some cases. Most were also performed solo, although he had occasional guest singers, notably Fay Hield and several extra voices on some of the carols that were the focus for December, based on the Sheffield tradition at Dungworth.          The project was supported with the release of 12 monthly digital albums, making all of the content available for download and ownership.          A recurring theme in Boden’s work is the social aspect of folksong and folk tunes and the idea that the folk tradition is a common heritage that belongs to all. It’s a theme he’s returned to again and again, notably with Spiers & Boden’s Backyard Tour (which included music relevant to the towns that they played) and in post gig sessions that have happened in bars and pubs after many shows, including the Bellowhead tour of November 2014.          As recently as October 2014 Jon used the theme as the main inspiration for his keynote address at The Folk Expo in Bury. He explored both the role of the folk singer as professional, but also suggested that there needs to be a balance between performance and participation.          At the start of 2013 Jon was commissioned by Jonathan Reckie, the musical director of Aldeburgh Music to create the show based on Britten’s ""The Ballad Of Little Musgrave And Lady Barnard"". It was part of a much wider global programme of events to celebrate Britten’s centenary, straddling the worlds of folk music, theatre and classical composition. The resulting piece used Britten’s setting of the ballad for male voice choir, interspersed with five ‘interpolations’ composed by Boden, with lyrics co-written by him and Mary Hampton. The soloists were Mary Hampton, Tim van Eyken, Rob Habron, James Findlay and The Peterborough Male Voice Choir. The production was directed by David Edwards and was staged at Snape Maltings Aldeburgh, Peterborough Cathedral and The Sage, Gateshead.          In 2013 Boden joined the Sacconi Quartet to perform Elvis Costello and the Brodski Quartet’s Juliet Letters at The Bristol Proms. In 2015 they performed the piece again at The Sacconi Quartet’s own Chamber Music Festival in Folkstone, with a performance scheduled for Lichfield Cathedral in July 2015 as part of the city’s annual festival.          In film and television Jon has written the soundtrack for the BBC TV version of the successful radio comedy Count Arthur Strong. Boden also contributed a version of Mike Scott’s ""How Long Will I Love You"" to the soundtrack of the Richard Curtis’ feature film ""About Time"", appearing as a busker in an extended montage sequence. Boden’s version of the song plays at the end of the film.          Boden composed ""All Hallows"" for Music to Move to, a part of the annual Dance Umbrella, London’s international dance festival, celebrating 21st century choreography across the capital and running since 1978. It was a commission from Fuel Theatre and the piece was used to create two videos, the first capture a performance from professional choreographer Vicki Igbokwe, the second a montage of footage from the public, who were encouraged to film their own response to the piece.          Boden has been commissioned to compose a short choral piece for The Bristol Proms 2015, to be performed at Bristol Old Vic Theatre by Erebus Ensemble, a 40 piece choir.","['English fiddlers', 'English folk musicians', '1977 births', 'Living people', 'English folk singers', 'Musicians from Chicago, Illinois', 'American emigrants to England', 'People from Winchester', 'Alumni of the University of West London']"

426500,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=426500,Kevin Millwood,"Kevin Austin Millwood (born December 24, 1974) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played for the Atlanta Braves, Philadelphia Phillies, Cleveland Indians, Texas Rangers, Baltimore Orioles, Colorado Rockies and Seattle Mariners.          While with the Braves, Millwood was part of a pitching rotation which featured Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz. In 1999 he was selected to his only All-Star Game and helped the Braves to the 1999 World Series and two seasons later the 2001 National League Championship Series. As a member of the Indians, his 2.86 ERA lead all American League pitchers. In 2012, Millwood became the 67th pitcher to record 2,000 career strikeouts.          Millwood graduated from Bessemer City High School in North Carolina. He has a           League ballpark named for him in Bessemer City. Millwood was married to Rena Stevens Millwood from 1999–2008 and had 2 children from that marriage.           Millwood was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 11th round of the 1993 MLB draft. After four years in the minors, Millwood made his debut with the Atlanta Braves on July 14, 1997. A year later, he won 17 games. Millwood formed a part of the Braves' star pitching rotation, which also consisted of Greg Maddux, John Smoltz and Tom Glavine. According to Nate Silver, the 1997 Braves starting rotation was the best in the history of baseball.          The 1999 campaign was one of Millwood's best. He posted career-highs in wins (18, also achieved in 2002), ERA (2.68), strikeouts (205) and WHIP (0.996). He finished third in the National League Cy Young voting (losing to the Arizona Diamondbacks' Randy Johnson) and 26th on the National League MVP ballot. He was selected as an All-Star in 1999, his only appearance in the Midsummer Classic.          Before the 2003 season, Millwood was traded by the Braves to the Philadelphia Phillies for catcher Johnny Estrada in order to cut their payroll in the midst of economic difficulties. He went 14-12 with his new team, including throwing a no-hitter against the San Francisco Giants on April 27 coming in the Phillies final season at the stadium. This was one of only two no-hitters ever thrown at the now-demolished Veterans Stadium. He also led the majors in stolen bases allowed, with 41.          In 2005, Millwood signed a one-year contract as a free agent with the Cleveland Indians. He came back from injury well, leading the American League in ERA (2.86). However, he managed a record of only 9-11, due to poor run support. During 2005, he again led the majors in stolen bases allowed, with 33. He was tied for 6th in the balloting for the AL Cy Young Award.          On December 26, 2005, the Texas Rangers signed Millwood to a five-year, $60 million deal.          In 2006, he and Vicente Padilla won 15 games; a total not matched by a Rangers pitcher until Scott Feldman in 2009.          In 2008, when batters did hit the ball against him, it was with uncommon success, as his .358 batting-average-against on balls in play was the highest in the major leagues. 26% of all balls put in play against him were line drives, the highest percentage in the majors.          Millwood was traded to the Baltimore Orioles on December 9, 2009, for Chris Ray and a player to be named later (left-handed pitcher Ben Snyder, a Rule 5 pick from San Francisco).          During the 2010 season, Millwood went 4-16 with a 5.10 earned run average, leading the league in losses.          On March 25, 2011, Millwood was signed to a minor league contract by the New York Yankees. After making three starts in the minor leagues, he opted out of his contract on May 1.          Millwood signed a minor league contract with the Boston Red Sox on May 19, 2011. He was released on August 7, exercising an opt-out clause.          On August 8, 2011, Millwood signed a minor league contract with the Colorado Rockies. Millwood was called up August 10 to fill a void after an injury to Juan Nicasio.          On January 22, 2012, it was reported that the Seattle Mariners had signed Millwood to a minor league contract. He was called up from Triple-A and made his first major league start of the season on April 22 against the Chicago White Sox. On May 13, Millwood became the 67th pitcher to record 2,000 career strikeouts when he struck out Yankee Curtis Granderson. Millwood notched a win over Yankee starter Andy Pettitte, who was pitching in the majors for the first time since 2010.          On June 8, Millwood pitched the first six innings of a combined no-hitter against the Los Angeles Dodgers before leaving the game due to a groin injury. Charlie Furbush, Stephen Pryor, Lucas Luetge, Brandon League, and Tom Wilhelmsen helped him complete the bid. Millwood was put on the disabled list in September with soreness in his shoulder and missed the remainder of the regular season.          On February 3, 2013, Millwood was reported to be retiring.          Millwood is a sinkerballer. His sinker is 89–92 mph and is complemented mostly by an 89–91 mph cutter and 83–86 mph slider. He also has a curveball (71–74) and a changeup (82–84) that he uses against left-handed hitters. His cutter tends to be used early in the count, with higher use of his breaking balls in 2-strike situations.","['1974 births', 'Living people', 'Atlanta Braves players', 'Philadelphia Phillies players', 'Cleveland Indians players', 'Texas Rangers players', 'Baltimore Orioles players', 'Colorado Rockies players', 'Seattle Mariners players', 'American League ERA champions', 'Baseball players from North Carolina', 'Major League Baseball pitchers', 'National League All-Stars', 'Sportspeople from Atlanta, Georgia', 'People from Gastonia, North Carolina', 'Gulf Coast Braves players', 'Danville Braves players', 'Macon Braves players', 'Greenville Braves players', 'Durham Bulls players', 'Richmond Braves players', 'Frisco RoughRiders players', 'Trenton Thunder players', 'Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees players', 'Pawtucket Red Sox players']"

Like ShareData, American Game Cartridges was headquartered in Chandler, Arizona. AGC published three video games for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1990.          Prior to the founding of American Game Cartridges, ShareData hired Richard C. Frick as Vice President of Product Development. Frick worked previously at Atari Games, and had some experience with their console game subsidiary, Tengen. Tengen was one of several game developers who rejected the contract terms that Nintendo imposed on its licensees. Instead, such developers published unlicensed games that defeated the NES's lockout chip. Frick was acquainted with this strategy, and applied it at ShareData's new company, American Game Cartridges. To defeat the NES's lockout chip, called 10NES, AGC licensed technology from Color Dreams.          AGC also licensed two titles from arcade game manufacturer Exidy: ""Chiller"" (1986) and ""Death Race"" (1976), which they adapted to the NES in 1990. ""Chiller"" was AGC's first game release, and was also ShareData's first title for the NES. ""Death Race"" quickly followed, as did an original work called ""Shockwave"" (1990).          Keeping with ShareData's business model of producing low-cost video games, AGC attempted to undersell their competition by as much as 30%. However, debts mounted throughout 1991, and by the fourth quarter AGC's creditors were trying to force the company into a reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States' Bankruptcy Code. ShareData itself was among the creditors pressuring American Game Cartridges, and American Game Cartridges filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 soon after. They remained in Chapter 11 until January 1994, when they finally filed their plan to reorganize.          Richard Frick left ShareData and American Game Cartridges amidst these difficulties, and started another unlicensed NES game development company called American Video Entertainment. Meanwhile, developer Keith Rupp of American Game Cartridges completed a fourth title, ""Wally Bear and the NO! Gang"", but AGC's financial difficulties preempted its release. Frick's new company secured the rights to the game, and published it in 1992.          American Game Cartridges planned several other game releases, including a conversion of Exidy's ""Crossbow"" (1983), but was unable to complete development.","['Companies based in Chandler, Arizona', 'Companies established in 1990', 'Companies disestablished in 1994', 'Defunct video game companies', 'Video game companies of the United States', 'Video game development companies', 'Video game publishers']"

4278497,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4278497,As the World Falls Down,"""As the World Falls Down"" is a song written by David Bowie in 1986 for the soundtrack of the film ""Labyrinth"".          The song is the backdrop for an illusion which Jareth the Goblin King (Bowie) builds around Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) through the use of an enchanted peach. The illusion is of a masquerade ball inside a bubble. Sarah is the only character in this scene without a mask, though Jareth removes his mask earlier in the scene.          The scene coupled with the song has been interpreted many ways. Some believe that the illusion is an attempt by Jareth to win Sarah's love; others believe he is trying to seduce her to distract her from the 13-hour time limit she has to rescue her brother Toby. or the third choice that it could be a double intention, as in Jareth is trying to do both.          Yet another theory is that the crystal ball represents everything Sarah wants and what Jareth is promising her; endless parties, dancing, glamor, fame, attention from a King, beautiful friends and adoration from all. As the scene becomes more sinister and she sees things for what they really are, however, Sarah is overcome with the realization that the world of the crystal is superficial, frightening and bizarre and not what she wants after all. Jareth's professed love for Sarah may be, in fact, a trap to turn her into a goblin. It is with this realization that she smashes the crystal ball and returns to the world of the Labyrinth for Jareth's last attempt to divert Sarah from her goal of rescuing Toby before he is turned into a goblin.          Another theory is that Jareth represents adulthood. If Sarah goes with him and chooses to be with him she will be giving up her childhood.          A video for ""As the World Falls Down"" was mooted for a Christmas 1986 single release, with a 3:40 edit and a video made by Steve Barron. However, perhaps because Bowie did not want the love ballad to lessen the impact of his intention to have a harder-sounding release in ""Never Let Me Down"", the single release was cancelled. The music video was later included on the second disc of the ""Best of Bowie"" compilation DVD.          The music video includes new footage mixed with clips from the film. It begins by showing an older Sarah (Charlotte Valandrey) relaxing in an office as a photocopier prints multiple images of Jareth's face. Meanwhile, Jareth is seen performing the track in an elegant room with Hoggle as his sole companion. A portrait of Sarah hangs on the wall. At one point the portrait crashes to the ground, prompting Jareth and Hoggle to look to the door as they falsely believe there is someone on the other side. The doorway is empty, and Jareth is seen staring ahead grimly upon realizing no one was there. Both Sarah and Jareth appear to want to go to the other, although neither of them are willing to take the first step.","['David Bowie songs', '1986 songs', 'Songs written by David Bowie', 'Song recordings produced by David Bowie', 'Music videos directed by Steve Barron', 'Pop ballads']"

4870318,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4870318,Autocollimation,"Autocollimation is an optical setup where a collimated beam (of parallel light rays) leaves an optical system and is reflected back into the same system by a plane mirror.          It is used for measuring small tilting angles of the mirror, see autocollimator, or for testing the quality of the optical system or of a part of it. Large-aperture optics, however, are tested with a null corrector avoiding the production of a large plane mirror.          One special application is to determine the focal length of a diverging lens: A light source is placed at twice the focal length of a converging lens on one side and a screen at the same distance on the other side so that the image of the light source is the sharpest possible. When this is achieved, the screen is replaced with a mirror and the diverging lens is inserted between the converging lens and the light source at such a distance to the mirror that the light returning through the diverging and converging lenses produces a sharp image on top of the luminous object. This is the case when the beam hitting the mirror is collimated. The distance found is the (negative) focal length of the diverging lens.          Light from an origin point O is collimated (made parallel) by a high quality objective lens. If the collimated beam falls perpendicularly onto a plane reflecting surface, the light is reflected back along its original path and is brought to a focus at a point coincident with the origin point. If the reflector is tilted through an angle θ, the reflected beam is deflected through an angle 2θ, and the image I is displaced laterally from the origin 0.The amount of displacement is given by d=2θf where f is the focal length of the lens, and θ is in radians.          Light from an illuminated target graticule at the focus of an objective lens is directed towards the lens by a beam splitter. After reflection by a mirror on the workpiece, the light returns through the Autocollimator and passes through the beam splitter, forming an image of the target graticule in the plane of an eyepiece graticule. The eyepiece graticule and the reflected image of the target graticule are viewed simultaneously through the eyepiece.          The image of the target graticule is always seen in focus and at constant magnification in the eyepiece, regardless of the distance between the Autocollimator and the reflecting surface. However, at long working distances only a portion of the reflected target graticule may appear in the eyepiece, owing to the failure of obliquely returning rays to enter the Autocollimator. This will result in a restricted measuring range.",['Optical metrology']

The MPP refused to participate in the vote, and Saikhanbileg was elected by a vote of 42-2.          Saikhanbileg's major task as Prime Minister has been to improve foreign investment in Mongolia, which took a dramatic turn for the worse in 2013, when Rio Tinto halted expansion at the Oyu Tolgoi mine in the Ömnögovi Province. Foreign investment fell nearly 4 billion between 2012 and 2015. In 2015 Saikhanbileg called for a ""text-message referendum"", polling the country for their opinion on major mining projects. When asked if the country should try to get out of financial trouble by support mining projects through investment, or cut costs, approximately 56% supported investment.","['1969 births', 'Democratic Party (Mongolia) politicians', 'Government ministers of Mongolia', 'Living people', 'Members of the State Great Khural', 'People from Dornod Province', 'Prime Ministers of Mongolia', 'National University of Mongolia alumni']"

The title attributes to Nālukettu, a traditional ancestral home (""Taravad"") of a Nair joint family. Like many other novels written by MT, ""Naalukettu"" is also set against the backdrop of the crumbling matrilineal order of Kerala in a newly independent India.          ""Naalukettu"" remains a classic in Malayalam fiction. It contributed to the renewal of a literary tradition initiated by S. K. Pottekkatt, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai and Uroob in the 1950s. It was given the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award in 1959. It has had 23 reprints (as of 2008) and was translated into 14 languages and had a record sale of a half a million copies (as of 2008) and still features in the best-seller lists.          Doordarshan adapted the novel into a television film in 1995. Malayalam actor Krishnaprasad enacted the protagonist in this film. It won the Kerala State Television Award for the year 1996. A screenplay based on the novel was released on 8 December 2012 as part of the DC International Book Festival, Thiruvananthapuram.          ""Naalukettu"" is a veritable depiction of the matriarchal social order of Kerala's Nair community in its final gasp for life. The hero Appunni is a scion of a once rich and powerful family. Appunni is the son of a woman who married a man of her own choices and who did not marry the man whom her Karnavar suggested. So she has to leave the family with her son and Appunni grows up without a father and away from the prestige and protection of the matrilineal home to which he belongs. The novel captures the traumas and psychological graph of Appunni, an introvert and angry youth, aspiring to avenge the insult meted out to him in a matrilineal family by building a new edifice on the ruins of his ancestral home.          ""The Hindu""'s critic K. Kunhikrishnan comments: """"Naalukettu"" was significant in that it fascinatingly portrayed the degeneration of the matrilineal system of joint families (tharawad), where large numbers of relatives lived together. The decline and collapse of the system resulted in nuclear families and consequential social, traditional and economic changes. But apart from the historical angle, ""Naalukettu"" has a lasting literary value, as one of the best in Malayalam fiction.""

Of note, she served as Canada's captain in a gold-medal winning effort at the 2014 4 Nations Cup in Kamloops, British Columbia.          Irwin grew up playing boys hockey until she was 16 and was the first girl to make a AAA-level boys team in Thunder Bay, ON. After moving to women’s hockey, she made Canada's national Under-22 team. Irwin was part of the gold medal winning Ontario Red squad at the January 2005 National Women’s Under-18 Championship in Salmon Arm, B.C. Irwin won the PWHL championship and OWHA provincial championship in 2005 and 2006 with the Toronto Jr. Aeros.

University of Minnesota Duluth women's hockey coach and former Canadian Olympic coach Shannon Miller recruited Irwin for UMD. When Irwin arrived in the fall of 2007 for her first season with the Bulldogs, she came in with more of an offensive game. She was not killing penalties and there were issues with her off-ice training and her weight. Miller made her fill out training logs, journaling all her workouts and her meals.          For the 2007–08 season, Irwin led UMD and the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) in scoring, was the league's Rookie of the Year and had the most points per game of any female U.S. college hockey player. For her effort, she was named WCHA Rookie of the Year and to the WCHA First All-Star, WCHA All-Rookie and WCHA All-Tournament teams.          She scored the game-winning goal to help UMD win the 2008 NCAA Division I national championship. The goal was vs. University of Wisconsin goaltender and Patty Kazmaier Award winner Jessie Vetter.

It has been referred to as Janáček's ""manifesto on love"".          The ""Intimate Letters"" quartet was the second to be composed after a request from the Bohemian Quartet who, in 1923, requested Janáček to compose two string quartets for them. Unusually for a classical work, the nickname ""Intimate Letters"" (""""Listy důvěrné"" in Czech) was given by the composer, as it was inspired by his long and spiritual friendship with Kamila Stösslová, a married woman 38 years his junior. The composition was intended to reflect the character of their relationship as revealed in more than 700 letters they exchanged with each other:          The première of the work took place on 11 September 1928, a month after Janáček died. The composition was performed by Moravian Quartet."".          It consists of four movements:          The viola assumes a prominent role throughout the composition, as this instrument is intended to personify Kamila. The viola part was originally written for a viola d'amore, however the conventional viola was substituted when Janáček found the viola d'amore did not match the texture. Milan Škampa of the Smetana Quartet has interpreted the third ""letter"", or movement, as a lullaby for the son that Janáček and Kamila Stösslová never had together.          The work is essentially tonal albeit not in the traditional sense. For example, the work closes with six D-flat major chords (Janáček's favourite chord), but with the added dissonance of an E-flat.","['Chamber music by Leo\xc5\xa1 Jan\xc3\xa1\xc4\x8dek', 'Compositions for string quartet', '1928 compositions']"

23705532,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23705532,The Heartbreaks,"The Heartbreaks are a British alternative rock band formed in Morecambe, Lancashire in 2009. The band consists of singer Matthew Whitehouse, songwriter and drummer Joseph Kondras, guitarist Ryan Wallace and bassist Christopher 'Deaks' Deakin.          The band formed in the seaside resort of Morecambe in 2009, brought together by a shared love of soul music, Orange Juice and gritty Northern literature. Before forming the band, Whitehouse and Kondras worked as ice cream men, Wallace was a roofer and Deakin ""just floated from place to place"". Whitehouse was the 2008–2009 North West's Under 21 Fastest Soft Serve Pourer. The competition was held in Skelmersdale, where he won £35 of WH Smith vouchers and a pair of monogrammed pouring gloves.          The band have been described as ""fanatical experts on the British seaside"", and many of their early rehearsals took place in an old snooker hall off the promenade. A few months after forming, the band were named ""Manchester Evening News"" Band of 2009.          In February 2010, the band were featured on a compilation EP released by independent label Fierce Panda, called ""Rip It Up"". Their inclusion, an early demo of song, ""Jealous, Don't You Know"", was given its first airplay by Steve Lamacq, who introduced it on his BBC Radio 6 Music show as ""Lipstick on Your Collar meets a juggernaut of guitars which veered off the motorway somewhere in the 1980s"". Lamacq would go on to describe a London Heartbreaks show around this time as ""like being at the infamous Sex Pistols show at the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, June 1976"".          The Heartbreaks released their debut single, ""Liar, My Dear"", through Parlophone subsidiary Seven Sevens, in March 2010. Described as ""an achingly beautiful debut"" by ""The Independent"", it was followed by a second release on Fierce Panda in August 2010, ""I Didn't Think It Would Hurt To Think Of You"", and a tour with former Libertines frontman Carl Barat, who described them as ""the finest support band I think I've ever had"". A third single, ""Jealous Don't You Know"", was released through their own imprint, Morecambe Rock, on Tri-Tone/PIASUK in March 2011, and was later remixed by English synthpop duo Hurts. These early singles earned the band comparisons to The Smiths and Manic Street Preachers in the ""NME"", who would also describe The Heartbreaks as one of ""the most exciting bands in the UK today"".          Throughout 2011, The Heartbreaks supported both Morrissey and Hurts across Europe, and performed for Bono in Milan, Kitsuné in Paris and Burberry in New York, with Chief Creative Officer, Christopher Bailey declaring, “I love their energy, effortless style and very British attitude”.          ""Funtimes"" was produced by Tristan Ivemy (Babyshambles, Frank Turner, The Holloways) with additional production from Joe Cross (Hurts, The Sound of Arrows) and the track ""Remorseful"" by Edwyn Collins and Sebastian Lewsley. It achieved notable success in Japan where lead single, ""Delay, Delay"", spent eight weeks in the Japan Hot 100, peaking at number nine in the chart. Delay, Delay was voted ""Track of 2012"" by readers of ""The Fly"", beating ""Pelican"" by The Maccabees with 6,000 votes. The Heartbreaks followed up Funtimes by releasing ""Polly"" as a single in September 2012 as well as a re-recorded version of ""Hand on Heart"", with strings arranged by James Banbury of The Auteurs, in February 2013.          After encountering the band in Morecambe, the co-editor of Crap Towns, Sam Jordison, wrote in The Independent about listening to ""Funtimes"", ""The music is bursting with energy, love and poison. Best of all, just about every song is about Morecambe. They have looked behind the grime and decline and found poetry. Suddenly, the town seems cool. The Heartbreaks point the way to a brighter future. It's even starting to seem like Morecambe's status as a Crap Town could be a thing of the past"".          In early April 2013, Edwyn Collins revealed in an interview with the NME that he would be releasing a co-written 7” single with the band entitled ""What Are You Doing, Fool?"" for Record Store Day 2013. The b-side to the release was a cover of Orange Juice song, 'Untitled Melody'.          On October 21, '¡No Pasarán!’, the first song to be taken from the band's then untitled second album, was made available to download for free from their official site. This was followed by two shows in London and Manchester, where tracks from the new album were performed live for the first time. The shows sold out in just a few hours.          In early March, the band announced via Twitter that their second album would be called ""We May Yet Stand A Chance"". Produced by Manic Street Preachers producer Dave Eringa, it is to be released in the UK on June 2nd, proceeded by the singles ""Hey, Hey Lover"" and ""Absolved"".          When asked what is new about the upcoming release, Whitehouse is quoted as saying, ""Oh, many things… Cowboy psychedelia, sleazy bar-room slide, dischordal white-noise wig-outs… It all feels like a natural transition though. Rather than a deliberate ‘change of direction’. Ultimately, we’ve committed to ideas more. Ideas were always inside us but that took seclusion from an increasingly gangrenous music scene to become focused and unforced"".","['British indie rock groups', 'People from Morecambe']"

He started his playing career at Portsmouth as a trainee in July 1988, but only made a handful of appearances in six years before moving to Barnet in 1994. At Barnet he became a regular starter making over 130 appearances in three seasons.          In June 1997, Exeter City manager Peter Fox paid £10,000 to bring Gale to St James Park, where he was again a regular starter before a series of injuries started to interrupt his career.          In August 2000, he moved on a free transfer to Havant & Waterlooville, where he made over 100 appearances in his first two seasons. He sustained a broken arm during a friendly in August 2003 and the repercussions kept him off the pitch for the whole of the 2003–04 season, eventually forcing his retirement from playing. In February 2004 he took up the position as David Leworthy's right-hand man and remained in the role under Ian Baird.

4162600,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4162600,Augustus Chapman Allen,"Augustus Chapman Allen (July 4, 1806 – January 11, 1864), along with his younger brother, John Kirby Allen, founded the City of Houston in the U.S. state of Texas. He was born on July 4, 1806, in Canaseraga Village, New York (the present day hamlet of Sullivan in the Town of Sullivan, New York), to Sarah (Chapman) and Roland Allen.          Not long after turning 17, Augustus graduated from the Polytechnic Institute at Chittenango, New York, and started teaching mathematics there. In 1827, he changed careers and resigned his professorship. He then went to work as bookkeeper for the H. and H. Canfield Company, New York. After two years, he and his brother John bought an interest in the business. In the summer of 1832, the Allen brothers left Canfield to move to Texas, where they settled in San Augustine. By June 1833, the brothers had moved to Nacogdoches.          The Allen brothers arrived first in Galveston, Texas, and then moved to the small town of Saint Augustine. In 1833, Allen and his brother associated with a group of entrepreneurs in Nacogdoches and started operating as land speculators.          Instead of joining the army when the Texas War of Independence started, Augustus and his brother engaged in the business of keeping supply channels open. At their own expense, they outfitted a ship, the ""Brutus"", for the purpose of protecting the Texas coast and assisting troops and supplies from the United States to arrive safely in Texas.          Nevertheless, some members of the Texas provisional government objected to the Allen brothers' activities, and rumors indicated they were engaged in privateering. In January 1836, they sold the ""Brutus"" to the Texas Navy, and it became only the second ship in the fledgling naval force. Augustus and John Allen continued to raise money and operate as receivers and dispensers of supplies and funds for the war effort without charge. In spite of the brothers' services, gossip and censure were aimed at the Allens because they were not in the armed services.          Financed by an inheritance received by Augustus's wife, Charlotte, on August 26, 1836, the Allen brothers purchased 6,600 acres (27 km²) along the Buffalo Bayou for $5,000, for the purpose of establishing a new city. At the suggestion of Charlotte, they named their townsite for the hero of the time, General Sam Houston.          In the years after his brother John's death in 1838, the Allen family grew apart and squabbled about the family's various businesses and finances, which had been somewhat commingled. These family disputes eventually led to Allen's separation from his wife in 1850.          Soon, Allen's health began to fail, and he decided to leave Houston, signing over to his wife, whom he had never divorced, most of what remained of his many enterprises. Augustus Allen relocated to Mexico to tend to his health and a new start in life.          In 1852, Augustus was appointed United States consul for the port of Tehuantepec on the Pacific Ocean, and in 1858 he was given the same position for the port of Minotitlán. These offices gave him control of the consular affairs of the United States for the entire Isthmus of Tehuantepec, a commercially important position.          Allen, in partnership with an Englishman named Welsh, developed an extensive private shipping business. He was never able to recover his health, however, and realized, in 1864, that he was critically ill. Augustus then closed his business and went to Washington, D.C. to resign his consulships. Soon after arriving there he contracted pneumonia, from which he would not recover.          Augustus Allen died on Monday, January 11, 1864 in Washington, D.C. and was buried in the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. Several Houston landmarks, including Allen Parkway and Allen Center, as well as Allen's Landing Park, immortalize Augustus and his brother, the city's two founders. <BR>          <BR>          ""New York Times"" (New York, NY), Fri., 15 Jan 1864, p. 5, c. 3 <BR>          ""New York Herald"" (New York, NY), Fri., 15 Jan 1864, p. 8, c. 3<BR>          <BR>          DIED - ALLEN - In Washington, D.C., on Monday, Jan. 11, Augustus C.

503915,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=503915,A Rush of Blood to the Head,"A Rush of Blood to the Head is the second studio album by British alternative rock band Coldplay. Released on 26 August 2002 in the UK through the label Parlophone, the album was produced by the band and British record producer Ken Nelson. Recording started after the band became popular worldwide with the release of their debut album, ""Parachutes"", and one of its singles in particular, ""Yellow"". The album makes greater use of electric guitar and piano than its predecessor.          The album was made available in August 2002, two months after its original planned release date. It was released on 27 August in the United States through Capitol Records. Capitol released a remastered version of the album in 2008 on a 180-gram vinyl record as part of the ""From the Capitol Vaults"" series. The album debuted and continued their huge commercial legacy, an ongoing pattern that began with ""Parachutes"" which made Coldplay one of the best-selling bands worldwide. It topped the UK Albums Chart upon its first week of release in the United Kingdom, and became the eighth biggest-selling album of the 21st century in the UK. The British Phonographic Industry has since certified the album 9× Platinum for its accumulated sales of over 2.8 million units in the UK and this album sold 20 million worldwide. The album spawned the hit singles ""In My Place"", ""The Scientist"", and ""Clocks"". ""God Put a Smile upon Your Face"" was also released, but was significantly less successful.          ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" has been critically acclaimed, and the band won the 2003 Grammy for Best Alternative Album for the second year in a row, and the 2004 Grammy for Record of the Year for the song ""Clocks"". In 2012 it was ranked number 466 on ""Rolling Stone's"" 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. It was also voted the best album of all time by the listeners of BBC Radio 2 in a poll conducted in 2013.          The band started recording the album in London a week after the September 11 attacks in the United States, during which their ""poignant songs ... garnered larger audiences"". Coldplay had never stayed in London for an extended period before and were bombarded by problems focusing on the production process. They decided to relocate to Liverpool, where they had recorded some of the songs on ""Parachutes"". Vocalist Chris Martin said that once there they ""became obsessed with recording"". ""In My Place"" was the first song recorded for the album and the one that the band released as the album's lead single ""because it was the song that made us want to do a second album. It kept us going and made us think we could still write songs"", following ""a strange period of not really knowing what we were doing"" three months after the success of ""Parachutes"".          The band wrote more than 20 songs for the album and some of those new tracks, including ""In My Place"" and ""Animals"", were performed live during the tours promoting ""Parachutes"". The album's title was revealed through a post on the band's official website.          During initial recording sessions in Liverpool, vocalist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland worked alone, and only on weekends. Each Monday, they would present the song ideas that they had developed to their bandmates. With ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" nearly completed, Martin went into the studio late one night and wrote a piano riff that he has stated ""just came out"". The band recognised that this early version of the song, that would become ""Clocks"", was special the first time Martin played it to them. Reasoning that it was too late to include the song on the album, they recorded a demo version and included it on a CD marked ""Songs for #3"", featuring unfinished tracks they intended to work on for their third studio album.          By June 2002, the band had completed ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"", but thought their output sounded ""rubbish"" and reached an agreement with the label to postpone the release of the album until they were completely satisfied. Subsequently, many songs were discarded because they sounded like they could have been on ""Parachutes"". Martin has claimed that it would have been uninteresting: ""It would have shown that we're happy to sit back on what we'd done, and we're not. For us, it was important to progress and try to improve upon our abilities as musicians."" Such ambitions put the band under strain: ""sometimes practice sessions ended abruptly with one or more members of Coldplay threatening to quit"".          After headlining the 2002 Glastonbury Festival, Coldplay returned to the studio and worked on some tracks from the ""Songs for #3"" they had produced earlier. Phil Harvey, the band's manager, heard ""Clocks"" and urged them to rework it immediately: ""No, you must do that song now 'cause you're going on [in the lyrics] about urgency, and you're talking about keeping this song back. That doesn't make sense.""          The album cover for ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" was designed by photographer Sølve Sundsbø. Sundsbø had been hired by fashion magazine ""Dazed & Confused"" in the late 1990s to produce something with a ""technological feel, something all white"". As an artist, he tried to do ""stuff that hasn't been done before, which is virtually impossible""; he suggested taking shots using a three-dimensional scanning machine.          The model for the shot wore an all-white makeup because it produces the ""best results""; for the image, the model wore a twill-coloured cape. The computer could not read the colours so it was replaced with spikes, and the head in the image was chopped because the machine only scanned 30 centimetres. The editor of the magazine liked the image and eventually featured it in one of their publications. Martin saw the image in the magazine and approached Sundsbø for permission to use the image as the cover of ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"". For the album's singles, Martin asked Sundsbø what he could do; the latter suggested scanning the head of each member of the band (Sundsbø also did artwork duties for the ""Live 2003"" home video).          The booklet contains only two photos; One with Coldplay in a location that was rumoured to be a forest, and one with the same band in the studio. The album cover was among the ten chosen by the Royal Mail for a set of ""Classic Album Cover"" postage stamps issued in January 2010.          Recording the album after 11 September attacks gave the band a fresh perspective: ""The new songs are reflective of new attitudes. [They tell listeners] not to be frightened. Anybody can achieve whatever they want to."" Most of the song lyrics are about urgency. Martin has commented that previous songs were more relaxed since they were in a comfortable state of mind: ""Perhaps there's a bit more urgency on some of these songs. And that's born from all the places we've been and the things we've experienced."" Martin has explained, in relation to the theme of urgency, that the album's title means ""doing something on impulse"". Several songs on the album are about relationships. These tracks are based on reality, but according to Martin, they were written with a fictional twist: ""Songs are like fairy tales: they have a beginning and an end and you can make it all work perfectly. Real life doesn't work like that"".          The album includes ballads and acoustic songs featuring extensive use of guitar and piano. The U2-esque ""epic rock"" of the album's opening track ""Politik"", the piano-driven ""Clocks"", the loud guitars of ""A Whisper"" and the Crowded House-inspired guitar in ""Warning Sign"" were seen as an extension of the band's musical range. Chris Martin has stated that the album's title track is an homage to American singer-songwriter Johnny Cash, whom he considered one of ""the greatest ... men with just guitars"".          The song ""Green Eyes"" was written by Chris Martin for two people: an ""American friend"" and bandmate, Jonny Buckland.          Upon release, ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" received universal acclaim from contemporary critics. Review aggregating website Metacritic reports a normalised score of 80% based on 25 reviews. Many felt that it built upon their previous album, ""Parachutes"". Alexis Petridis of the newspaper ""The Guardian"" wrote that the band's ""new assurance is everywhere ... the timidity of ""Parachutes"" is nowhere to be found"". He concludes, ""It sounds like an album ready to take on the world, and win.""          Kelefa Sanneh of ""The New York Times"" praised the album, commenting that it is ""one of the year's best albums"" and describing it as ""sparser, stranger and even catchier than its predecessor"". ""Rolling Stone"" magazine's Rob Sheffield, said that """"A Rush of Blood to the Head"" is a nervier, edgier, thoroughly surprising album"", adding, ""where ""Parachutes"" was the clumsy diary of a high-strung kid, ""A Rush of Blood"" sounds more like a band with the confidence to test its own limits."" Ted Kessler of ""NME"" lauded the album, calling it ""an album of outstanding natural beauty, an organic, wholesome work."" MacKenzie Wilson of AllMusic echoed the above comments, saying that it is a ""strong album"". Wilson, who compliments Martin for his ""sharpened"" falsetto and refined ""haunting delivery"" and Buckland for his ""riveting guitar work"", notes that ""regardless of the band still being in their mid-twenties, they've made an amazing record"". Emma Pearse of the American newspaper ""The Village Voice"" has the same sentiments, stating that it is ""a little edgier, trancier, and more conversational"" compared to ""Parachutes"". Robert Christgau gave the album a one-star honourable mention () and quipped, ""Let Green Eyes dump him for real and we'll see how long he hums in the void.""          ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" made an entrance into the UK Albums Chart upon its debut week, entering at number 1 and moving 273,924 copies. The British Phonographic Industry has since certified the album eight times platinum for its accumulated sales of over 2.4 million copies.

Gershenfeld (born 1959 or 1960) is an American professor at MIT and the director of MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms, a sister lab to the MIT Media Lab. His research studies are predominantly focused in interdisciplinary studies involving physics and computer science, in such fields as quantum computing, nanotechnology, and personal fabrication. Gershenfeld attended Swarthmore College, where he graduated in 1981 with a B.A. degree in physics with high honors, and Cornell University, where he earned his Ph.D.in physics in 1990. He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society. ""Scientific American"" has named Gershenfeld one of their ""Scientific American 50"" for 2004 and has also named him Communications Research Leader of the Year. Gershenfeld is also known for releasing the ""Great Invention Kit"" in 2008, a construction set that users can manipulate to create various objects.          Gershenfeld has been featured in a variety of newspapers and magazines such as ""The New York Times"" and ""The Economist"", and on NPR.          He was named as one of the 40 modern-day Leonardos by the Museum of Science and Industry Chicago. ""Prospect"" named him as one of the top 100 public intellectuals.          In 1998, Gershenfeld started a class at MIT called ""How to make (almost) anything"". Gershenfeld wanted to introduce expensive, industrial-size machines to the technical students. However, this class attracted a lot of students from various backgrounds: artists, architects, designers, students without any technical background. In his interview to CNN, Gershenfeld said that ""the students... were answering a question I didn't ask, which is: What is this stuff good for? And the answer is: Not to make what you can buy in stores, but to make what you can't buy in stores. It's to personalise fabrication"". Gershenfeld believes that this is the beginning of a new revolution: digital revolution in fabrication that will allow people to fabricate things, machines on demand.          Gershenfeld has presented his course on ""How to make (almost) anything"" at the Association of Professional Model Makers (APMM) 2010 Conference.          This class later has led Gershenfeld to create Fab lab in collaboration with Bakhtiar Mikhak at MIT. Gershenfeld feels very passionate about this project, as he believes that teaching kids how to use technology and create it themselves will empower the future generations to become more independent and create technology that each individual community needs, not a technology that is currently available on the market. Fab labs have spread around the world, having been established in the remotest of places and countries. In his interview with ""Discover magazine"" on the question what personal fabrication might be useful for, Gershenfeld said, ""There is a surprising need for emergent technologies in many of the least developed places on the planet. While our needs might be fairly well met, there are billions of people on the planet whose needs are not. Their problems don't need incremental tweaks in current technology, but a revolution"".          As well as ""How to make (almost) anything"" class, Gershenfeld has started teaching the following classes: ""How To Make Something That Makes (almost) Anything"", ""The Physics of Information Technology"", ""The Nature of Mathematical Modeling"".          Neil Gershenfeld and his students have done an extensive amount of research. His research was published in Science (journal) as well as in The American Physical Society journal. Amongst many is the research on Experimental Implementation of Fast Quantum Searching, Microfluidic Bubble Logic research, Physical one-way functions.","['Year of birth missing (living people)', 'Living people', 'American physicists', 'Harvard Fellows', 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty', 'Cornell University alumni', 'Swarthmore College alumni']"

He was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, and has worked on dozens of United States Congressional and Senatorial races. In 1998 he moved to Israel to serve as a consultant to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, became his chief of staff, and afterwards formed a partnership with political consultant Arthur Finkelstein.          He was a staffer at a national Republican Party committee in a United States election cycle, and worked more than a dozen international campaigns. His work includes polling, strategy, paid media and grassroots coalition building, developing and implementing campaign strategies.          Birnbaum took his first paid position in a political campaign in 1992, signing onto Ohio Republican Congressman Bob McEwen’s reelection campaign. In the years following, he worked on more congressional races, including campaigns in North Carolina, Florida and Virginia.          During the 1996 cycle, Birnbaum served as the deputy political director and director of survey research under National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Alfonse D'Amato. Birnbaum worked on two dozen races in an election where Republicans broke the historical pattern and won two seats in the U.S. Senate. Following the 1996 cycle, Birnbaum managed Charlie Crist’s 1998 unsuccessful challenger campaign against incumbent Senator Bob Graham in Florida.          It was after the 1998 cycle that Birnbaum consulted for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s campaign. Birnbaum served as Netanyahu’s chief of staff, a position he held for a year and a half.          After serving Prime Minister Netanyahu, Birnbaum took a hiatus from political work, spending the next two years concentrating on international philanthropy and charitable work. In 2003, Birnbaum went into partnership with American conservative political consultant Arthur Finkelstein.          Since then, the two have consulted and managed campaigns throughout Europe and the Middle East, including the successful campaigns of Prime Minister of Israel Ariel Sharon, Chancellor of Austria Alfred Gusenbauer, Prime Minister of Bulgaria Sergei Stanishev, Prime Minister of Romania Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu, Prime Minister of Kosovo Hashim Thaçi, and President of Serbia Boris Tadic. In 2008, they worked to elect Nir Barkat as mayor of Jerusalem, and in 2009 they helped Avigdor Lieberman’s Yisrael Beiteinu party become the third largest party in Israel – a position of strength which resulted in Mr. Lieberman’s ascension to the position of Foreign Minister in Prime Minister Netanyahu’s cabinet.","['American political consultants', 'Living people']"

Chu Chu Ramirez (Ricardo Montalban), a farm laborer from Mexico who works as a grape picker in California, has recently become an American citizen and is determined to better himself. While his cousin Manuel and his friends Celestino and Willie spend their pay on gambling and women, Chu Chu buys new clothes and an encyclopedia. When grape season ends, Chu Chu takes a job clearing land for Ansel Ames (Wendell Corey) on Ames' farm near Sacramento. Ames and his wife (Claire Trevor) are having marital problems and the lonely Mrs. Ames, who initially regards Chu Chu with contempt as a ""foreigner"", becomes attracted to Chu Chu over time. Chu Chu is friendly and kind to her, but does not return her affections and rejects her attempt to seduce him. Instead, Chu Chu is drawn to Nancy (Shelley Winters), a troubled waitress with a drinking problem whose former husband, a test pilot, was killed in a crash. Chu Chu puts up his prized possession, a letter from President Franklin D. Roosevelt, to get money for Nancy, and asks her to be his girl, although she protests that he shouldn't waste his time on a ""wino"" like herself.           Meanwhile Chu Chu has finished his work for Ames and receives his paycheck, but when Chu Chu goes to cash the check, the bank refuses payment. When Chu Chu confronts Ames about the bad check, Ames threatens him with a shotgun. Chu Chu brings the matter before a labor board and is promised his pay within sixty days. He plans to find Nancy, who has moved to Los Angeles, and marry her as soon as he receives his pay. However, at the end of the sixty days, when Chu Chu again attempts to collect his pay from Ames, Ames attacks him, causing Chu Chu to knock him down and leave. Ames and his wife then argue and Mrs. Ames tells her husband that Chu Chu is worth ten of him, causing Ames to hit her. She falls into a gun rack and a gun goes off, striking Ames in the shoulder. The Ameses falsely accuse Chu Chu of shooting Ames and he is arrested. After learning that Nancy has attempted suicide in Los Angeles, Chu Chu escapes from jail to rush to her side; they are briefly reunited but police soon find Chu Chu and take him back into custody.          At Chu Chu's trial, both Ames and Mrs. Ames repeat the false claim that Chu Chu shot Ames, and he is found guilty, although the jury requests and the judge grants a light sentence. Nevertheless, Chu Chu will lose his citizenship for being a convict, something he considers a ""fate worse than death"". Feeling that injustice has been done, Chu Chu's cousin and friends camp just outside the Ames property, staring at the Ameses, playing Mexican songs and doing other things that constantly remind the Ameses of Chu Chu. Nancy, who is still ill, arrives and accuses Mrs. Ames of destroying Chu Chu before collapsing and being rushed to the hospital. The Ameses attempt to reconcile with each other and realize they must tell the truth, that Chu Chu did not shoot Ames, even though they will be charged with perjury. Following their confession, Chu Chu is released and reunites with Nancy at the hospital.

He is considered a ""pioneer of FM rock,"" who played an important role in the progressive rock era of FM broadcasting. He was the first person to host a rock music show on New York City's FM band, commencing November 21, 1964 on WFUV. By broadcasting progressive rock and long album tracks, he was noted for introducing a musical alternative to Top 40 AM radio in New York in the late 1960s and early 1970s. ""Billboard"" called his station ""a legend, affecting and inspiring people throughout the industry.""          He gave early exposure to country-rock bands like Buffalo Springfield and Poco, and did one of the first American interviews with Elton John. In 1991 he was co-host of ""Paul Simon Live in Central Park"" and was often called to be an expert guest commentator on PBS specials, including those featuring Bob Dylan, John Fogerty, The Grateful Dead, Jimi Hendrix, Roy Orbison, Peter, Paul and Mary, Simon & Garfunkel, James Taylor and others.          Starting with WOR-FM in 1966, FM was demonstrating a large rift from AM broadcasting. Fornatale was a key figure in this trend with his weekly program, ""Campus Caravan,"" which was heard on Fordham University's WFUV from 1964 to 1970. He began professionally in 1969 at WNEW-FM and also worked at WXRK (née WKTU). He returned to WFUV in 2001 and was heard weekly on his shows, ""Mixed Bag"" and ""Mixed Bag Radio,"" which is also on XM satellite radio. He won the Armstrong Excellence in Broadcasting Award in 1983. Mr. Fornatale received AFTRA's Media & Entertainment Excellence Award in February 2012 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City.          He was a native of the Belmont section of the Bronx and attended Fordham Preparatory School and Fordham University, where he received a B.A. in Communication Arts in 1967. He was a member of the board of World Hunger Year.          Fornatale wrote several books, including ""The Rock Music Source Book,"" ""Radio in the Television Age,"" ""The Story of Rock 'n' Roll,"" and ""All You Need Is Love."" He was also helped write ""The Elvis Collection"" trading card series. In addition, he has written many feature shows for radio and television about Rock, including the syndicated ""Rock Calendar,"" episodes of ""MTV""'s ""Rock Influences,"" and the international television series ""Deja View."" His latest book is ""Back to the Garden: The Story of Woodstock.""          He hosted rock-related programs on WNET, PBS's station in New York City, and was an on-air consultant for rock music shows and specials on VH1, MTV and HBO.          In June 2010, Fornatale joined the crew of The Voice of Peace Network with his show ""Back To The Garden"" in support of WhyHunger.org. His show features Pete reflecting on some of his favorite friends and musicians.          In the summer of 2011, Fornatale toured the Northeast with two different multimedia programs to support his most recent book releases. The show titled ""Back to the Garden: The Story of Woodstock"" focused on Fornatale's experiences as an on-air personality during that period, and it is highlighted by Woodstock-related anecdotes based on events that occurred throughout the DJ's lengthy career as an interviewer, DJ and author. The program titled ""How Terribly Strange to be 70"" looked at the tumultuous history of Simon & Garfunkel, beginning with their early years when they performed as the duo 'Tom and Jerry'. He was working on a book on the Rolling Stones at the time of his death.          Mr. Fornatale died at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City at age 66 on April 26, 2012.

300148,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=300148,Alhamdulillah,"Al-ḥamdu lillāh () or alḥamdulillāh is an Arabic phrase meaning ""Praise be to God"". It is frequently used by Muslims of every background, due to its centrality to the texts of the Quran and the words of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, but also spoken by some Arabic-speaking Christians and Jews.          The meaning and in-depth explanation of the phrase have been the subject of much exegesis.          The phrase has three basic parts:          The word ""Allah"" is itself the fusion of the definite article al (the) and the word ilah (a god, deity). Like in English, the article is used here to single out the noun as being the only one of its kind, ""the god"" (the one and only) or ""God"" with a capital G (the concept of capital letters does not exist in Arabic). Therefore, ""Allah"" is the Arabic word for ""God"". ""ilāh"" is the Arabic cognate of the ancient Semitic name for God, El.          The phrase is first found in the second verse of the first sura of the Qur'an (Al-Fatiha). So frequently do Muslims and Arabic-speaking Jews and Christians invoke this phrase that the quadriliteral verb ""hamdala"" (حمدل), ""to say al-Hamdu li-'llah"" was coined, and the derived noun ""hamdalah"" (حمدلة) is used as a name for this phrase.          On any occasion and in any situation when Muslims desire to praise God, they may say: ""Alhamdulillah"" (الحمد لله).          The triconsonantal root Ḥ-M-D (ح م د), meaning ""praise,"" can also be found in the names Muhammad, Mahmud, Hamid and Ahmad.          English translations of ""Alhamdulillah"" include:           Jabir ibn Abd-Allah wrote in a hadith that Muhammad, said: ""The best remembrance of God is to repeat La ilaha ilallah and the best prayer (du'a) is Alhamdulillah (all praise belongs to God)."" (Narrated by Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, and Hakim who declared its chain 'sound'.)          Abu Huraira wrote that Muhammad said: ""Any matter of importance which is not begun with Alhumdulillah remains defective."" From Abu Dawood          Anas bin Malik wrote that Muhammad said: ""God is pleased with his slave who says, 'Alhumdulillah' when he takes a morsel of food and drinks a draught of water.""","['Arabic words and phrases', 'Islamic terminology', 'Gratitude']"
85538,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=85538,Ops,"In ancient Roman religion, Ops or Opis (Latin: ""Plenty"") was a fertility deity and earth-goddess of Sabine origin.          In Ops' statues and coins, she is figured sitting down, as Chthonian deities normally are, and generally holds a scepter or a corn spike as her main attributes. The husband of Ops was Saturn.          In Roman mythology, and in Greek mythology where Ops is identified as Rhea, her husband was Cronus, the bountiful monarch of the Golden Age. Cronus was Rhea's husband and brother.          In Latin writings of the time, the singular nominative (""Ops"") is not used; only the form ""Opis"" is attested by classical authors. According to Festus (203:19), ""Ops is said to be the wife of Saturn and the daughter of Caelus. By her they designated the earth, because the earth distributes all goods to the human genus"" (""""). The Latin word ""ops"" means ""riches, goods, abundance, gifts, munificence, plenty"". The word is also related to ""opus"", which means ""work"", particularly in the sense of ""working the earth, ploughing, sowing"". This activity was deemed sacred, and was often attended by religious rituals intended to obtain the good will of chthonic deities such as Ops and Consus. ""Ops"" is also related to the Sanskrit word ""ápnas"" (""goods, property"").          According to Roman tradition, the cult of Opis was instituted by Titus Tatius, one of the Sabine kings of Rome. Opis soon became the patroness of riches, abundance, and prosperity. Opis had a famous temple in the Capitolium. Originally, a festival took place in Opis' honor on August 10. Additionally, on December 19 (some say December 9), the Opalia was celebrated. On August 25, the Opiconsivia was held. Opiconsivia was another name used for Opis, indicating when the earth was sown. These festivals also included activities that were called Consualia, in honor of Consus, her consort.          Opis, when syncretized with Greek mythology, was not only the wife of Saturn, she was his sister and the daughter of Caelus. Her children were Jupiter, Neptune, Pluto, Juno, Ceres, and Vesta. Opis also acquired queenly status and was reputed to be an eminent goddess. By public decree temples, priests, and sacrifices were accorded her.","['Earth goddesses', 'Fertility goddesses', 'Roman goddesses', 'Rhea']"

He entered the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) on July 17, 1848, and graduated 15th in a class of 29 cadets on July 4, 1851. Throughout his final year he served as ""a cadet captain and company commander"". While attending VMI, Vaughan was a classmate of William Y.C. Humes, who stood 2nd in the class and would also serve as a Confederate general in the Civil War.          Vaughan took up civil engineering as his chosen profession, and initially moved to Saint Joseph, Missouri, working as a surveyor for the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad. Soon afterward he relocated to Southern California, where he served as deputy U.S. surveyor. He then briefly was on the staff of an official for the Northern Pacific Railroad. In this work Vaughan served as the private secretary of Alfred Cumming (uncle of Confederate general Alfred Cumming) who represented the railway in peace treaty talks with the Indians living on the upper portion of the Missouri River.           Finally settling in Marshall County, Mississippi, Vaughan took up work as a farmer. There he met Martha Jane Hardaway (1838–1911) and they were married on November 6, 1856, having eight children together. He was still working as a planter in Marshall County when the war began in 1861.          When the Civil War began in 1861, Vaughan chose to follow his home and adopted states and the Confederate cause, despite his strong Unionist feelings. He raised a company of fellow Mississippians for service, however the state was unable to arm and equip them, so Vaughan led them north to Moscow, Tennessee. There his men (dubbed the ""Dixie Rifles"") were added to the 13th Tennessee Infantry Regiment, and Vaughan entered the Confederate Army as its captain that May. That June the regiment was reorganized, and on June 7 he was elected its lieutenant colonel.           Vaughan and his regiment first saw action during the Battle of Belmont on November 7, 1861. On December 4 he was promoted to colonel and was given command of the 13th Tennessee. He then fought during the Battle of Shiloh on April 6–7, 1862, and was lightly wounded on the first day of the battle. Vaughan's conduct in this fight has been described as: "" ...he led his troops in a charge against the Union right, routing an Ohio regiment and causing a nearby battery to abandon 3 of its guns."" Beginning that fall he was given brigade command in the Army of Tennessee and both its previous namings (Army of Kentucky and of Mississippi).          Recovering from the injury, Vaughan participated in the Battle of Richmond on August 29–30, and the Battle of Perryville on October 8. He also fought during the Battle of Stones River (also called the Battle of Murfreesboro) from December 31 to January 2, 1863. Vaughan's most notable service was during the Battle of Chickamauga on September 17–18, 1863, after which he was given a field promotion personally by Confederate President Jefferson Davis ""for conspicuous gallentry."" Vaughan was promoted to brigadier general effective November 18, 1863, ""in recognition for his service to the Confederacy at Chickamauga."" An account of his performance in that fight follows:          During the Chattanooga Campaign that followed, Vaughan fought at the Battle of Missionary Ridge on November 25, 1863. He then participated in the Atlanta Campaign of 1864, and on July 4 Vaughan led his brigade during a skirmish at Vining's Station just after the Battle of Marietta on the previous day. Up to this point he had escaped serious injury, despite having at least eight horses shot from under him in combat. However, in this fight he was severely wounded when his leg was cut off by an exploding artillery shell, ending his active military service with the Confederate States. On May 10, 1865, Vaughan was paroled from Gainesville, Alabama, and returned home.          After the American Civil War ended in 1865, Vaughan returned to farming in Mississippi. In 1872 he moved to Tennessee, where into 1873 he participated in the Grange Movement at Memphis. He served as a general agent of the movement, responsible for the organization of state granges in Mississippi, Arkansas, and Tennessee. Vaughan also opened a mercantile business while in Memphis.          In 1878 Vaughan was elected clerk of the criminal court of Shelby County, Tennessee, and was re-elected in 1882. From 1897 until his death Vaughan has the head of the United Confederate Veterans chapter in Tennessee. Also in 1897 he published his book ""Personal Record of the Thirteenth Regiment, Tennessee Infantry"". He died two years later in Indianapolis, Indiana, and his body was returned to Memphis for burial in the city's Elmwood Cemetery.","['Confederate States Army brigadier generals', 'People of Virginia in the American Civil War', 'People from Dinwiddie County, Virginia', '1830 births', '1899 deaths', 'Virginia Military Institute alumni', 'American planters']"

The first was the E class of nine Double Fairlie steam locomotives of 1872-75; the second E class consisted of a Mallet compound made in 1906; and as both were no longer operated by the New Zealand Railways Department in 1923, the classification was free to be used for a third time when the small battery electric locomotive was delivered. This is the only time a classification has been used three times in New Zealand, though re-use happened a number of other times, arguably most notably when the A class of 1906 took the designation originally used by the A class of 1873.          This particular E class was ordered for service on the newly electrified Otira Tunnel section of the Midland line and was constructed in 1922. In April 1923, English Electric delivered an order of six locomotives: five EO class mainline locomotives that collected electricity from overhead wires, and a sixth small battery electric locomotive for maintenance duties. It was classified as E 1, had a wheel arrangement of Bo-Bo-2 under the UIC classification system, and worked for the rest of the 1920s.          Clearly not an exceptional performer, it was written off around 1930 due to the costs involved in maintaining its batteries. Instructions were issued for any equipment that could not be re-used elsewhere from the locomotive to be dumped locally. E 1's cab can still be found alongside the track just south of Otira. The runner wagon for E 1 was stripped of its batteries and found use at Addington Workshops as a general purpose wagon around the complex.

He joined professional sumo in 2000. His highest rank was ""maegashira"" 14, achieved in 2006. After illness saw him demoted to the third ""makushita"" division in 2008, he returned to the second highest ""jūryō"" division in 2010 and the top ""makuuchi"" division in September 2011. After winning the Sandanme division he had just been demoted to in November 2013, he chose to retire. He is now a coach at Sakaigawa stable.           He was born in the city of Hirosaki (as was Wakanosato). Hōchiyama was a member of Kizukuri High School sumo club (also attended by Mainoumi) and he made his professional debut in March 2000. He joined the Nakadachi stable set up by former ""komusubi"" Ryogoku, which was subsequently renamed Sakaigawa stable.          Hōchiyama took the ""jonokuchi"" championship with a perfect 7-0 record in his first tournament as a ""rikishi"" and he earned promotion to ""sandanme"" in November 2000 with another 7-0 score. However he found his opponents in the third ""makushita"" division much more difficult to deal with and his progress slowed. He narrowly missed out on promotion to the second highest ""jūryō"" division a number of times, recording 3-4 marks at ""makushita"" 1 in July 2004 and November 2005. After 24 tournaments in the third division he finally achieved promotion in January 2006 when a 4-3 score at ""makushita"" 4 was enough to reach ""jūryō"". He became the second member of his stable to reach ""sekitori"" status, following Iwakiyama, and the first to do it progressing through all the professional sumo divisions, Iwakiyama having made his debut in ""makushita"".          Hōchiyama reached the top ""makuuchi"" division in only in three tournaments, after winning the ""jūryō"" championship in July 2006 with a 13-2 record. He could only manage five wins in his top division debut in September 2006 and was demoted back to ""jūryō"". He reappeared in ""makuuchi"" in May 2007 but after two more ""make-koshi"" or losing scores he fell back to the second division once again in September of that year. He just missed out on immediate promotion back to the top division after recording seven wins against eight losses at the rank of ""jūryō"" 1. However, restricted by diabetes, a disastrous performance of 2-13 at the rank of ""jūryō"" 6 in the March 2008 tournament (which was his sixth consecutive losing score) saw him demoted to the third division for May.          After more than two years in ""makushita"", he finally returned to the ""sekitori"" ranks in July 2010 after scoring 5-2 at the rank of ""makushita"" 1 West in May. He came through with a winning record of 8-7, securing his ""kachi-koshi"" on the final day after four straight losses. He was one of seven ""rikishi"" from Sakaigawa stable ranked in ""jūryō"" in September 2010, the others being Iwakiyama, Goeido, Toyohibiki, Sadanoumi, Sadanofuji and Shironoryu. After a solid 9-6 at Juryo 5 in July 2011, he was promoted back to the top division for September after a 23 tournament absence - the fourth longest ever. He scored only 5-10 on his return and was immediately demoted back to ""juryo"", but he ensured with an 8-7 score at ""Juryo"" 1 in January 2012 that he was promoted to ""makuuchi"" once again for the March 2012 tournament. However he failed in his fifth attempt at a top division ""kachi-koshi"", finishing on 4–11.          In November 2013, after dropping to the ""sandanme"" division for the first time since the beginning of his career, Hōchiyama managed to take the championship. He still chose to retire before the beginning of the following January 2014 tournament. He has remained in sumo as a coach under the ""toshiyori"" or elder name of Kimgahama Oyakata. He had 29 tournaments at a ""sekitori"" rank; normally 30 are required to become an ""oyakata"" but Hochiyama was allowed because his stablemaster and previous owner of the stock acted as guarantors, under new Sumo Association rules brought in on November 17, 2013.           Hōchiyama's favourite techniques were listed by the Sumo Association as ""migi-yotsu"" (a left hand outside, right hand inside grip on his opponent's ""mawashi""), ""yori"" (grappling) and ""tsuki"" (thrusting).

38614423,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38614423,Terminalia,"Terminalia was an ancient Roman festival in honour of the god Terminus, who presided over boundaries. His statue was merely a stone or post stuck in the ground to distinguish between properties. His worship is said to have been instituted by Numa who ordered that every one should mark the boundaries of his landed property by stones to be consecrated to Jupiter Terminalis, and at which every year sacrifices were to be offered at the festival of the Terminalia. On the festival the two owners of adjacent property crowned the statue with garlands and raised a crude altar, on which they offered up some corn, honeycombs, and wine, and sacrificed a lamb or a suckling pig. They concluded with singing the praises of the god. The public festival in honour of this god was celebrated at the sixth milestone on the road towards Laurentum doubtless because this was originally the extent of the Roman territory in that direction.          The festival of the Terminalia was celebrated VII. ""Kal. Mart."", or the 23d of February on the day before the Regifugium. The Terminalia was celebrated on the last day of the old Roman year, whence some derive its name. We know that February was the last month of the Roman year, and that when the intercalary month Mercedonius was added, the last five days of February were added to the intercalary month, making the 23d of February the last day of the year. When Cicero in a letter to Atticus says, ""Accepi tuas litteras a. d. V. Terminalia"" (i.e. Feb. 19), he uses this strange mode of defining a date, because being then in Cilicia he did not know whether any intercalation had been inserted that year.          The central Terminus of Rome (to which all roads led) was the god's ancient shrine on the Capitoline Hill. The temple of Jupiter, king of the gods, had to be built around it (with a hole in the ceiling as Terminus demanded open-air sacrifices) by the city's last king, Tarquinius Superbus, who had closed down other shrines on the site to make room for this prestigious project. But the augurs had read into the flight patterns of birds that the god Terminus refused to be moved, which was taken as a sign of stability for the city.","['Ancient Roman festivals', 'February observances']"

1169169,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1169169,Bicinium,"In music of the Renaissance and early Baroque eras, a bicinium (pl. bicinia) was a composition for only two parts, especially one for the purpose of teaching counterpoint or singing.          The term has had two usages in music history:          The term was first used in Poland, by Jan z Lublina in a treatise of 1540. Volumes of bicinia were published in the next several decades in Germany, the Low Countries, and even in Italy, as the usefulness of bicinia as teaching aids became apparent. In addition, Martin Luther had strongly expressed that children should learn both music, and the psalms: bicinia with German texts from the Psalms fulfilled his purpose.          Students could be expected to master singing a single part in a duet more easily than a part in a larger ensemble. Usually a bicinium was designed to be sung or played by students of the same age and ability, rather than for a single student and a teacher.          This model of moving from two-part study, writing, and singing to three parts and then more was adopted by Heinrich Glarean in his ""Dodecachordon"" (1547), one of the most influential music theory and pedagogy treatises of the Renaissance.          In a similar manner, present-day music students typically learn counterpoint first by writing in two parts, and then later in three, only moving to four or more parts after mastering the earlier stages.          A similar pedagogical composition for three voices is known as a tricinium (pl. tricinia).","['Renaissance music', 'Baroque music', 'European music', 'Music education']"
6494456,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6494456,Lillian Smith (author),"Lillian Eugenia Smith (December 12, 1897 – September 28, 1966) was a writer and social critic of the Southern United States, known most prominently for her best-selling novel ""Strange Fruit"" (1944). A white woman who openly embraced controversial positions on matters of race and gender equality, she was a southern liberal unafraid to criticize segregation and work toward the dismantling of Jim Crow laws, at a time when such actions virtually guaranteed social ostracism.          Smith was born on December 12, 1897, to a prominent family in Jasper, Florida, the seventh of nine children. Her life as the daughter of a middle-class civic and business leader took an abrupt turn in 1915 when her father lost his turpentine mills. The family was not without resources, however, and decided to relocate to their summer residence in the mountains of Clayton, Georgia, where her father had previously purchased property and operated the Laurel Falls Camp for Girls.          Now a young adult financially on her own, she was free to pursue her love of music and teaching for the next five years. She spent a year studying at Piedmont College in Demorest, Georgia (1915–1916). She also had two stints at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore in 1917 and 1919. She returned home and helped her parents manage a hotel and taught in two mountain schools before accepting a position to be director of music at a Methodist school for girls in Huzhou, (now Wuxing, Zhejiang), China. She was not a churchgoer and did not consider herself religious.          Her time in China was limited, however, by problems back home. Her father's health was declining and she was forced to return home to the States in 1925. Back in Georgia, she assumed the role of heading the Laurel Falls Camp, a position she would hold for the next twenty three years (1925–48). Laurel Falls Camp soon became very popular as an innovative educational institution known for its instruction in the arts, music, drama, and modern psychology. Her father died in 1930, and she was left with responsibility for the family business and the care of her ill mother. It was this period of creative control over the camp, her ability to use it as a place to discuss modern social issues, combined with the pressures of caring for her ailing parents that made her turn to writing as an emotional escape.          Lillian Smith soon formed a lifelong relationship with one of the camp's school counselors, Paula Snelling, of Pinehurst, Georgia. The two remained closeted as a same-sex couple for the rest of their lives, as their correspondence has shown. The couple began publishing a small, quarterly literary magazine, ""Pseudopodia"", in 1936. The magazine encouraged writers, black or white, to offer honest assessments of modern southern life, to challenge for social and economic reform, and it criticized those who ignored the Old South's poverty and injustices. It quickly gained regional fame as a forum for liberal thought, undergoing two name changes to reflect its expanding scope. In 1937 it became the ""North Georgia Review"", and in 1942 finally settling with ""South Today"".          In 1944 she published the bestselling novel ""Strange Fruit"", which dealt with the then-forbidden and controversial theme of interracial romance. The title was originally ""Jordan is so Chilly"", with Smith later changing the title to ""Strange Fruit"". In her autobiography, singer Billie Holiday wrote that Smith chose to name the book after her song ""Strange Fruit"", which was about the lynching and racism against African-Americans, although Smith maintained that the book's title referred to the ""damaged, twisted people (both black and white) who are the products or results of our racist culture."" After the book's release, the book was banned in Boston and Detroit for ""lewdness"" and crude language. ""Strange Fruit"" was also banned from being mailed through the U.S. Postal Service, with the ban against the book being lifted by President Roosevelt after his wife Eleanor Roosevelt requested it of him.          In 1949, Smith kept up her personal assault on racism with ""Killers of the Dream"", a collection of essays that attempted to identify, challenge and dismantle the Old South's racist traditions, customs and beliefs, warning that segregation corrupted the soul. She also emphasized the negative implications on the minds of women and children. Written in a confessional and autobiographical style that was highly critical of southern moderates, it met with something of a cruel silence from book critics and the literary community.          In 1955, the civil rights movement grabbed the entire nation's attention with the Montgomery bus boycott. By this time she had been meeting or corresponding with many southern blacks and liberal whites for years and was well aware of blacks' concerns. In response to Brown v. Board of Education, the ruling that outlawed segregation in schools, she wrote ""Now Is the Time"" (1955), calling for compliance with the new court decision. She called the new ruling ""every child's Magna Carta"".          Smith battled breast cancer from the early 1950s on and died on September 28, 1966, at the age of 68. Her book ""The Journey"" (1954) details some of this battle.          Today, ""Strange Fruit"" remains her most famous work, translated into fifteen languages, but many of her works, like ""Killers of the Dream"", are being rediscovered and given their due as groundbreaking in both style and substance. She no doubt deserves recognition as one of the first prominent Southern whites to write about and speak out openly against racism and segregation. Her lifelong convictions are summed up in her acceptance speech for the Charles S. Johnson Award at Fisk University in 1966: ""Segregation is evil; there is no pattern of life which can dehumanize men as can the way of segregation.""          Since 1968, the Lillian Smith Book Awards have been presented annually, except for 2003 when the Southern Regional Council experienced funding shortfalls.

Duke Albrecht was born in Vienna as the eldest child of Duke Philipp of Württemberg and his wife Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, daughter of Archduke Albert, Duke of Teschen.          At the start of World War I, Duke Albrecht commanded the German 4th Army and led them to victory in the Battle of the Ardennes in August 1914. Following this victory, the 4th Army saw action in the First Battle of the Marne before being transferred to Flanders in October, where Duke Albrecht commanded them during the Battle of the Yser. Duke Albrecht also commanded the German forces during the Second Battle of Ypres, where poison gas was used on a large scale for the first time.          Duke Albrecht was awarded the Pour le Mérite in August 1915 and was promoted to Generalfeldmarschall in August 1916. The newly formed Army Group Albrecht was placed under his command in February 1917 and he was responsible for the southern sector of the Western Front until the Armistice.          Duke Albrecht had become heir presumptive to the Kingdom of Württemberg following the death of his father in October 1917, but, following the German Empire's World War I defeat and the abdication of his cousin King Willhelm II of Württemberg following the German Revolution, he never succeeded to the throne. He became head of the House of Württemberg on the death of Wilhelm on October 2, 1921.          Duke Albrecht died at Altshausen Castle on October 29, 1939. His son Duke Philipp Albrecht succeeded him as head of the House of Württemberg.           Duke Albrecht was married in Vienna on 24 January 1893 to Archduchess Margarete Sophie of Austria, a daughter of Archduke Carl Ludwig.

1885219,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1885219,4th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht),"The 4th Panzer Division () was an armoured division in the German Army, the Wehrmacht, during World War II, established in 1938.          It participated in the 1939 invasion of Poland, the 1940 invasion of France, and the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union. It remained on the Eastern Front, mainly under Army Group Centre, until it was trapped on the coast at Courland in the summer of 1944. It was evacuated by sea and returned to the main front in West Prussia in January 1945. It surrendered to the Soviets there at the end of the war.           During the Polish campaign, the division engaged in a series of massacres against the civilian population and POW's.          The 4th Panzer Division was formed in Würzburg, Bavaria, on 10 November 1938 as the first of a second wave of new armoured divisions in Germany following the creation of the original three tank divisions in 1935. Alongside the 4th Panzer Division the 5th was formed at Oppeln, now Opole in Poland, five days later.          Würzburg had previously been the garrison town for the 2nd Panzer Division which had moved its head quarters to Vienna after the ""Anschluss"" of Austria in March 1938.          At the beginning of the Invasion of Poland (1939), the division was one of the first to cross the border in the operational area of Army Group South. Equipped with roughly 341 tanks, including 183 Panzer I, 130 Panzer II, 12 Panzer IV and 16 PzBef. The division lacked some infantry and anti-tank units. Polish historian Mieczysław Bielski wrote that immediately after entering Polish territory, on 1 September, the division used civilians as human shields during the battle of Mokra. During that battle the division was fighting the Polish Volhynian Cavalry Brigade under Colonel Julian Filipowicz. According to the Polish historians Kazimierz Leszczyński and Janusz Gumkowski, a Polish aircraft was shot down on 3 September and its crew taken prisoner. One of its passengers was brutally interrogated, tortured (German soldiers cut off his nose, ears and tongue) and then executed by personnel of the 4th Division.          After supporting 1st Panzer, the division took part in the break-through of the Polish lines near Kłobuck, the Poles withdrew. Three days later, the 4th Panzer Division continued its move towards Warsaw. It reached the Polish capital on 8 September and tried to take the city by surprise. At 17.00, the forces of the 4th Panzer Division supported by the 31st Infantry Division attempted an assault on Warsaw's western borough of Ochota. The assault was repulsed and the German forces suffered heavy casualties. The following day, the division was reinforced with artillery and the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler motorised infantry regiment, and began another assault towards Ochota and Wola. Well-placed Polish anti-tank guns and barricades erected on main streets repulsed this assault. On several occasions, the lack of armament on the Polish side was made up for by ingenuity. One of the streets leading towards the city centre was covered with turpentine from a nearby factory. When German tanks approached, the liquid was set on fire, and the tanks were destroyed without a shot being fired. The German forces suffered heavy casualties and had to retreat. After the failed assault on Warsaw, 4th Panzer Division was withdrawn westward and took part in the Battle of the Bzura, where it supported a German counter-attack.          Polish-Jewish historian, Szymon Datner, stated that on 18 September, in the village of Śladów, units of the 4th Panzer Division shot or drowned 252 prisoners of war and 106 civilians in the Vistula.          After that it was withdrawn to the Niederrhein.          During the Battle of France in 1940, the division came under the command of Erich Hoepner's XVI Panzer Corps, part of von Kleist's Panzer Group in the 6th Army commanded by Walther von Reichenau. After a blitzkrieg assault through Liege and Charleroi, it reached the area of Bethune, where it fought against the British Expeditionary Force in what became known as the battle of Dunkirk. However, due to Adolf Hitler's orders, it did not manage to capture Dunkirk itself. In early June 1940, the division managed to cross a large part of France in several days. By the time that the cease fire was signed, it had reached Grenoble almost unopposed. After several months of occupation duty in France, in late November, the 4th Division was withdrawn to Würzburg, where it was reorganized and reinforced. The 36th Panzer Regiment was detached and assigned to the newly formed 14th Panzer Division, while the 103rd Artillery Regiment was reinforced with a third battalion.          The division was moved to East Prussia and then to the area of Brześć Litewski in occupied Poland, where it was assigned to the XXIV Panzer Corps under Geyr von Schweppenburg. On 22 June 1941, it took part in the opening stages of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. During the first day, the division managed to drive a wedge into the Soviet positions and reached Kobryń some 65 kilometres behind the lines. The division then spearheaded one of the pincer moves to surround and destroy a large Soviet force in the battle of Minsk, where the German army took approximately 300,000 prisoners. After the battle of Homel it reached Kiev, where it fought against another pocket of resistance.          In September 1941, the division was attached to Army Group Centre, which was preparing to take part in the battle of Moscow. The assault started on 30 September 1941, the division captured Orel in early October but was ambushed on the road to Mtsensk by 1st Guards Rifle Corps on the 6th of that month. Attempts by the outclassed Panzers to maneuver round the Soviet flanks were defeated with heavy loss as the soviet T-34s savaged the underarmored Mark IV tanks, reducing much of the divisional armor to burned out, smoking wreckage by end of day. The advance resumed with growing loss and in late October Heinz Guderian concentrated most of the 2nd Panzer groups' remaining tanks into a single brigade under the 4th Panzer division, the spearhead of the XXIV Panzer Corps. By mid-November it was down to 50 tanks but still ground on reaching Tula, as the southern arm of a pincer which tried to surround the Soviet capital. The Germans formations were paralysed when the autumn rains set in, turning the only road to Tula into a stretch of mud. Bogged down German tanks were attacked by Soviet aircraft. With the onset of frost in early November, the Germans could use the roads again, but faced the problem of not being equipped for winter warfare. Warm clothing and white camouflage suits were lacking, and tanks and other vehicles were immobilised as temperatures dropped below freezing.          On 5 December, the division was withdrawn and ordered to defend a stretch of front near Moscow against a . In a series of retreats, the division lost almost all of its tanks. A month later it had only 25 machines still operational. It withdrew to the Orel area, where the thaw halted the Soviet counter-offensive and the unit could be partially reinforced. Throughout 1942 it fought in the battle of Orel, a series of almost World War I-like skirmishes, assaults and counter-assaults. It took part in the failed battle of Kursk, after which it withdrew to the area along the Desna River. After a series of Soviet advances, the front line was finally stabilized near Bobruysk, where the division spent the winter of 1943–1944.          In the spring of 1944, the division moved to the area of Kowel in occupied Poland, where it was to support Army Group South during the expected Soviet spring offensive. However, Operation Bagration, (started on 22 June 1944), was aimed at Army Group Centre and the division retreated with the rest of the German army. Assigned to the XXXIX Panzer Corps under Gen. Karl Decker, the division withdrew to the area of Warsaw, where the Soviet advance ran out of momentum at the end of July. The 4th Panzer Division took part in the Battle of Radzymin (also known as the Battle of Wołomin) and on 2 August 1944, alongside the 19th Panzer Division, threw the Soviet III Tank Corps back to Wolomin. The Soviet Tank Corps suffered heavy losses and their advance halted.          The division was then transported to northern Lithuania, where it was to support Army Group North. It was attached to the 3rd Panzer Army. The Soviet advance cut the German army group in two and the division was mostly dispersed. Some of its sub-units were cut off from the rest of German-held territory, along with the 16th and 18th Armies, in Livonia on the Courland Peninsula, where they supported the defense until the end of the war. Other units were attached to smaller, often improvised formations. They were destroyed by the Soviet offensive of April–May 1945.

4716261,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4716261,Pagoclone,"Pagoclone is an anxiolytic drug from the cyclopyrrolone family, related to better-known drugs such as the sleeping medication zopiclone. It was synthesized by a French team working for Rhone-Poulenc & Rorer S.A. It is one of a relatively recently developed class of medicines known as the nonbenzodiazepines, which have similar effects to the older benzodiazepine group, but with quite different chemical structures.          Pagoclone was originally developed as an anti-anxiety drug, but never commercialised. It is a partial agonist acting at GABA receptors in the brain. In contrast to zopiclone, pagoclone produces anxiolytic effects with little or no sedative or amnestic actions at low doses. This is because pagoclone is a subtype-selective drug which binds primarily to the α/α subtypes of the GABA receptor which are responsible for the anti-anxiety effects of drugs of this kind, but has relatively little efficacy at the α subtype which produces the sedative and memory loss effects.          Prof. David Nutt has suggested pagoclone as a possible base from which to make a better social drug, as it produces the positive effects of alcohol, such as relaxation and sociability, but without also causing the negative effects like aggression, amnesia, nausea, loss of coordination and liver damage. Its effect can be quickly reversed by the action of flumazenil, which is already used as an antidote to benzodiazepine overdose.          Nutt has published studies praising the potential of pagoclone which were financed by Indevus which holds the patents to the pharmaceutical and is, as of Spring 2006, seeking funding for a possible production of the compound. The significance of this is undetermined, but the long-term safety of pagoclone has not been assessed. The abuse potential of pagoclone has been assessed as being similar to, or slightly less than that of diazepam and it would also be expected to be somewhat safer due to its relatively weaker sedative effects, but development of pagoclone as a commercial drug would still be unlikely due to concerns about abuse.          Pagoclone is also being trialed as a drug to improve a stammerer's speech fluency.          Pagoclone and pazinaclone are both isoindolone          Reaction of 2-Amino-7-chloro-1,8-naphthyridine with phthalic anhydride leads to the corresponding phthalimide. Selective reduction of one of the imide carbonyl groups give the corresponding alcohol. Reaction with the carbanion from Ethyl 5-methyl-3-oxohexanoate leads to the product from the displacement of the hydroxyl group; 'this too may proceed via the acrylate obtained from aldol reaction of the ring opened imidal'.","['Anxiolytics', 'Chloroarenes', 'Cyclopyrrolones', 'GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators', 'Isoindolines', 'Ketones', 'Lactams', 'Naphthyridines']"

Born in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, Mills received his earliest instruction from his father, who was organist at Gloucester Cathedral. The father was a great admirer of Johann Sebastian Bach, hence the name he gave his firstborn son. In adulthood, Mills simply signed himself ""S.B. Mills."" In spite of the name and his father's vocation, Mills chose piano over the organ. His precocious talent brought him to the attention of the French light music composer Louis-Antoine Jullien, who engaged the ""infant prodigy"" for his earliest concert performances.          Young Mills played at Drury Lane Theatre in London in 1846 at the age of six, performing Czerny’s ""Rondo Brillant on Themes from Preciosa"" and gave a command performance before Queen Victoria at age seven. He studied in England with Cipriani Potter and William Sterndale Bennett and at the Leipzig Conservatory with Louis Plaidy, Carl Czerny, Ignaz Moscheles, Julius Rietz and Moritz Hauptmann. At Leipzig, he met his future wife, Antonia Young, a native of Germany whose family had emigrated to Chicago.          He went to America in 1856 and, after some disappointing initial receptions, was engaged by New York Philharmonic Society music director Carl Bergmann to perform the Schumann ""Piano Concerto in A minor"". Its favorable reception before a largely German-speaking crowd let Bergmann to re-engage Mills for other performances, and the pianist appeared annually with the Philharmonic Society from 1859 to 1877. He also made tours of Germany in 1859, 1867 and 1878. A personal friend of William Steinway, he performed exclusively on Steinway pianos.          Mills retired from active concertizing in 1880 - coincident with the arrival in New York of pianist Rafael Joseffy, who was more often engaged by the New York Philharmonic's new music director, Theodore Thomas to play Mills' repertoire – and he subsequently devoted himself to teaching. Suffering from failing health in his latter years, he moved to Germany at his wife's insistence in April 1898 and died in Wiesbaden on December 21.

Growing up in Frankish Schweinfurt – his father was a Lutheran minister – it was already clear to him as a child that he wanted to go into a religious profession. From 1890 Rittelmeyer studied philosophy and Protestant theology in Erlangen and Berlin evangelische. Among his teachers were Adolf von Harnack and Julius Kaftan, and later Oswald Külpe, who encouraged him to write his dissertation on Friedrich Nietzsche.          He also went on a study trip to meet theologians and socially-engaged ministers of the time, as well as members of the Moravian Church. From 1895 to 1902 he was at the Stadtvikar in Würzburg, from which in 1903 he took up the preachership of Heilig-Geist-Kirche in Nuremberg. There he married Julie Kerler on 5 April 1904. Rittelmeyer worked and closely collaborated with Christian Geyer (1862–1929), the head preacher of the Sebalduskirche, and the pair produced two joint volumes of sermons. Around 1910 they both led discussions with the Bavarian church council on a liberal interpretation of the Bible and the denomination.          In 1916 Rittelmeyer was sent to the Neue Kirche in Berlin, working as preacher there. At first gripped by nationalist enthusiasm, he soon came to oppose the First World War and with 4 other Berlin theologians signed a proclamation of peace and understanding on the occasion of Reformation Day (October 1917).          The Nuremberg school teacher Michael Bauer in 1910 enabled Rittelmeyer to have his first encounter with Rudolf Steiner, the founder of anthroposophy. Rittelmeyer described the encounter and discussed Steiner's personality and work in his ""Meine Lebensbegegnung mit Rudolf Steiner"" (""Rudolf Steiner Enters my Life""). In the ""Christengemeinschaft"" he established in September 1922, Rittelmeyer acted as its first Kultushandlungen (Priesterweihe der Begründenden und Altarsakrament). He was the first ""Erzoberlenker"" of the ""Movement for Religious Revival"" (another term for the Christengemeinschaft) and from its base in Stuttgart was its leading envoy right up to his death. Under National Socialism, he carried out a permanent balancing act: between critical intellectual discussion with Nazism in numerous publications on the one hand and his task of enabling a survival strategy for the Christengemeinschaft (for which he felt responsible) on the other.","['1872 births', '1938 deaths', 'People from Dillingen an der Donau', 'People from the Kingdom of Bavaria', 'German Protestant clergy', 'Anthroposophists']"

3141359,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3141359,Abdul Nacer Benbrika,"Abdul Nacer Benbrika () (born in Algeria about 1960), also known as Abu Bakr (Arabic: أبو بكر), was one of 17 men arrested in the Australian cities of Sydney and Melbourne in November 2005, charged with being members of a terrorist organisation and of planning terrorist attacks on targets within the country. Benbrika is alleged to be the spiritual leader of the group. All 17 men pleaded not guilty. On 15 September 2008 Benbrika was found guilty on the charge of intentionally being the leader and a member of a terrorist organisation.          Benbrika was born in Algeria: various sources give his age as 45 or 46 as of November 2005. He was trained as an aircraft engineer. He arrived in Australia in May 1989 on a one-month visitor's permit, on which he twice gained extensions, and settled in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, an area with a large Muslim population. After his permit expired in 1990 he became a prohibited non-citizen, then spent the next six years fighting through the Immigration Review Tribunal appeals process, for the right to stay. During his hearings he told the tribunal of his ""love of the Australian lifestyle"".          In 1992 Benbrika married a Lebanese woman who was an Australian citizen, with whom he had seven children. He was granted Australian residence in 1996 and became a citizen in 1998, although he is reported to have retained his Algerian citizenship as well. He has been on government welfare benefits for so many years and this has become a topic of debate.          His teachings became increasingly politicised after the US-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. This came at a time when the Muslim community was under intense scrutiny from the Australian government and media outlets.          Benbrika was said to have been a teacher and a deputy-leader at the Islamic Information & Support Centre of Australia led by Mohammed Omran who, as Sheikh Abu Ayman, also lead the Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaah Association (Australia). Omran has denied that he had close ties with Benbrika.          Benbrika began teaching smaller groups on a less formal basis after he refused the requests of more formal organisations that he tone down his teachings.          Islamic Council of Victoria board member Waleed Aly said Benbrika's group was ""a splinter of a splinter of a splinter. Most Muslims had never heard of him until he appeared on the ABC's [""7.30 Report]""."" Waleed Aly was quoted as saying. ""... He formed his own group with a handful of young men who he calls his students."" Benbrika's students included a number of those arrested along with him in November, one of whom is alleged to have undergone military training in Afghanistan.          Benbrika came to public attention when he told an Australian ABC interviewer: ""Osama bin Laden, he is a great man. Osama bin Laden was a great man before 11 September, which they said he did it, until now nobody knows who did it."" He was quoted as defending Muslims fighting against coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, and said anyone who fought in the name of God would be forgiven their sins. ""According to my religion, jihad is a part of my religion and what you have to understand is that anyone who fights for the sake of Allah, when he dies, the first drop of blood that comes from him out all his sin will be forgiven.""          During 2004 and 2005 Australian security agencies had Benbrika under surveillance as a possible instigator of terrorist acts. In March his passport was withdrawn on advice from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), and ASIO agents raided his Melbourne home in June. In November, according to media reports, ASIO became convinced that Benbrika's group, and affiliated group in Sydney, was actively planning a terrorist attack. It was at this time that the federal government was introducing new anti-terrorism legislation, the Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005. It is said that on the advice of ASIO, the Australian Parliament amended the law relating to terrorism, broadening the definition of planning 'a' terrorist act. A few days later police raids in Sydney and Melbourne arrested Benbrika and 16 other men, one of whom was shot after allegedly opening fire on police in Sydney. It has also been said that the timing of the arrests was planned to coincide with the new laws.          Benbrika and his 12 fellow defendants (including Shane Kent, Fadal Sayadi, Ahmed Raad, Amer Haddara, Abdulla Merhi Ezzit Raad, Hany Taha and Aimen Joud) appeared in a Melbourne magistrate's court the day after their arrest. All are of Muslim immigrant backgrounds except Kent, who is a convert. Benbrika was charged with ""directing the activities of a terrorist organization."" He did not apply for bail and was remanded in custody. Several of his fellow defendants applied for bail on numerous occasions during their pre-trial remand detention in the maximum security Acacia Unit of Barwon Prison, from November 2005 until their trial began in February 2008.          Benbrika also had links to the defendants in the 2005 Sydney terrorism plot, Khaled Cheikho, Moustafa Cheikho, Mohamed Ali Elomar, Abdul Rakib Hasan, and Mohammed Omar Jamal.          Government and police officials said the group was stockpiling chemicals that could have been used to make explosives, Butthey had not been charged with this offense. According to the Melbourne ""Herald Sun"", the group was ""plotting a terrorist spectacular on the scale of the al-Qaeda attacks on London and Madrid."" The explosive device they were assembling was called the ""Mother of Satan"" by the jihadists. Victorian police commissioner Christine Nixon said she believed the arrests, which came after 16 months of police surveillance, had ""seriously disrupted the activities of a group intent on carrying out a terrorist attack"". The raids were planned after new information was obtained, she said. She said although the group had no known specific target, ""We were concerned that the attack was imminent, and we believe that we have sufficient evidence that will go before the courts to show that.""          In an interview before his arrest, Benbrika denied he was involved in terrorist activities. ""I am not involved in anything here,"" he said. ""I am teaching my brothers here the Koran and the Sunnah, and I am trying my best to keep myself, my family, my kids and the Muslims close to their religion.""          In company with the other defendants, Benbrika appeared in a Melbourne court in March 2007, under extremely strict security. The proceedings of the case are subject to severe reporting restrictions in Victoria.          The trial of Benbrika began in October 2007. He and 11 other accused were charged of terrorism offences. The case was presided over by Justice Bernard Bongiorno and was initially prosecuted by Nick Robinson, but later trials included Richard Maidment SC as prosecutor. Benbrika was represented by Remy Van de Weil QC with Josh Taaffe of Doogue & O'Brien (now Doogue O'Brien George) instructing him.          At a hearing in February 2008, the prosecution in its opening remarks outlined the details of 500 phone conversations, recorded by telephone intercepts and hidden listening devices, between Benbrika and the 11 men in his group also on trial. Prosecutors alleged phone records revealed the group's plans: ""to cause maximum damage. To cause the death of a thousand ... by use of a bomb.""          They allege the group led by Benbrika was ""bent on violent jihad"" and ""planned terrorist attacks on football games or train stations to maximise deaths"" and that Benbrika said that in some cases it was theologically permissible to ""kill women, children and the elderly"".          The court was told how Benbrika allegedly used at least 10 different mobile phones that were registered under false names and addresses.          The jury in the case retired to consider its verdict on 20 August 2008. On 15 September Benbrika was found guilty on the charge of intentionally being the leader and a member of a terrorist organisation.          On 3 February 2009 Supreme Court Justice Bernard Bongiorno sentenced Benbrika to 15 years jail with a non-parole period of 12 years. In his comments Bongiorno said the word jihad had many meanings in Islam, but Benbrika had warped the term to mean ""only a violent attack by his group to advance the Islamic cause"". Bongiorno also said evidence ""suggested that Benbrika was still committed to violent jihad, had shown no contrition for his offences and had talked about continuing the group's activities behind bars if its members were jailed"".          Apart from the charges of Intentionally being a member of a terrorist organisation and Intentionally directing activities of a terrorist organisation, Benbrika was also convicted in a later trial of Possession of a thing connected with preparation for a terrorist act. But a further ruling in March 2011 has found him not guilty of this later charge. This conviction for the offence of Possession of a thing connected with preparation for a terrorist act was quashed, with the court concluding ""that the trial judge had misdirected the jury as to the requirements for establishing that offence."" His sentence for the charge of Intentionally being a member of a terrorist organisation was also reduced from 7 to 5 years.          While in jail, Benbrika has been able to exert significant influence in spreading jihadist ideology. Associates and relatives of his have died fighting for Islamic State.","['Algerian emigrants to Australia', 'Australian activists', 'Muslim activists', '1960s births', 'Living people', 'Algerian Islamists', 'Australian Islamists', 'Sunni Islamists', 'Australian prisoners and detainees', 'Algerian Sunni Muslims', 'Australian Sunni Muslims', 'People imprisoned on charges of terrorism', 'Islamist insurgents', 'War on Terror', 'Australian people of Algerian descent']"

2115308,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2115308,Moishe Postone,"Moishe Postone (born 1942) is a Canadian Western Marxist historian, philosopher and political economist. He is Professor of History at the University of Chicago, where he is part of the Committee on Jewish Studies.          Moishe Postone, son of a Canadian Rabbi, received his Ph.D. from University of Frankfurt in 1983.          His research interests include modern European intellectual history; social theory, especially critical theories of modernity; twentieth-century Germany; anti-Semitism; and contemporary global transformations. He is co-editor with Craig Calhoun and Edward LiPuma of ""Bourdieu: Critical Perspectives"" and author of ""Time, Labor and Social Domination: A Reinterpretation of Marx's Critical Theory"". He is also co-editor with Eric Santner of ""Catastrophe and Meaning: The Holocaust and the Twentieth Century"", a collection of essays that consider the meaning of the holocaust in twentieth-century history and its influence on historical practice. Postone's work has had a large influence on the anti-Germans.          He was originally denied tenure by the University of Chicago's Sociology Department, sparking a great deal of public resentment from graduate students whom he had been involved in teaching. He was later granted tenure by the History Department.          Today Moishe Postone is the Thomas E. Donnelley Professor of Modern History and co-director of the Chicago Center for Contemporary Theory.          In 1978 Postone started a critical analysis on Marx's theory of value.          But Moishe Postone's most distinguished main work, 'Time, Labor and Social Domination', was published in 1993 (translated into French in 2009 and Japanese in 2012).          In his works he proposes a fundamental reinterpretation of Karl Marx's critique of political economy, focusing on Marx's original concepts value, capital and labour. Inspired by heterodox Marxist thinkers such as Isaak Rubin, Roman Rosdolsky, etc., and certain authors of the Frankfurt School, e.g., Sohn-Rethel, who remained marginal to that school, he shows that the assumptions of the 'pessimistic turn' of Horkheimer were historically rather than theoretically founded. Postone interprets critical writings on Marx's economics, especially in its Capital 1 edition, and Grundrisse, as the development of a social-mediational theory of value.          Postone thinks that in writing the 'Grundrisse' Marx concludes that adequate critical theory must be completely immanent to its purpose. The criticism cannot be taken from a point of view external to its object, but must appear in the mode of presentation itself. Das Kapital is so structured, for Postone, with a surface level immanent to political economics discourse and a deeper layer that grounds this discourse, which makes it particularly difficult to interpret. Indeed, precisely because of the inherent nature of the format Marx uses, the object of the critique of Marx has often been taken as the standpoint of this criticism. For example, not only is the categories of exchange value historically specific to the capitalist period, but also value's basis, the capitalist form of wage labour, must also be historically specific, and does not apply conceptually to other periods. The methodological sections of the Grundrisse clarify therefore not only Marx's presentation, but other sections make explicit that the categories of capital such as value and exchange-labour, are historically specific to the capitalist social formation. The so-called labour theory of value is not a theory of the material wealth created by labor but is in a parallel manner also seen when looked at transhistorically as ""human metabolism with nature."" Precisely because it is not structured immanently, the 'Grundrisse' provides a key to read Capital. This is the key to the reinterpretation of the work of mature Marx, with which Postone works.          Starting in this demonstration of the historically specific character of what Marx critiques, Postone then provides a new critical theory that attacks the very essence of capitalism: the form of labour specific to the capitalist social formation. Indeed, in non-capitalist societies, work is distributed by overt social relations. An individual acquires goods produced by others through the medium of undisguised social relations. Work activities derive their meaning and are determined by personal relationships, openly social and qualitatively specific (differentiated by social group, social status, the wide range of customs, traditional ties, etc.). But in a capitalist social formation, ""the objectification of labor is the means by which goods produced by others is acquired; we work to acquire other products So someone other than producer that uses the product (as well as use value) - the producer, it serves as a means for acquiring work products from other producers. It is in this sense that a product is a commodity. It is both use-value for each other and medium of exchange for the producer. This means that the work has a dual function; on one hand, it is a specific type of work that produces goods individuals to others, but on the other hand, the work, regardless of its specific content, is the producer of means to acquire the products of others. This feature of the work, which is specific to the social life in capitalism, is the basis of modern socialization, is called ""abstract labor."" In the functioning of these new social relationships, labour under capitalism is no longer an external activity to capitalism. It is the foundation of capitalism, and so is the labour that must be abolished.          It appears increasingly today that the new concept of ""commodity fetishism,"" which has nothing to do with a hoax of consciousness (an inverted representation), is the central part of the intellectual heritage Marx. ""Commodity fetishism"" is not only a misrepresentation, much less an exaggerated adoration of goods. The ""fetish"" instead is to be referred to the structure of the commodity. It is then a theory of ""objective fetishism"" (Jappe) or radicalized, that is to say, so long as value (the objectification of the specific function of the spirit of labour under capitalism), the goods and money, society is actually governed by the self-movement of created things themselves, and not by the subjective manipulation of the ruling classes. The subjects are not men, but it is rather their objectified relationships that are at the heart of socialization under capitalism. Fetishism, Postone notes, must be analyzed ""in terms of the structure of social relations constituted by forms of praxis and its seizure by objectifying the category of capital (and hence value). The Subject for Marx, like Hegel is so abstract and can not be identified with any social actor whatsoever ""(Postone, Time, p. 75-76). This is the world where abstract labour (which is not immaterial labor) becomes the social bond, social mediation that mediates itself, reducing actual work to a simple expression abstract labor. Abstract labor is then the source of alienation. The self-moving subject, Spirit, Geist, is misrecognized in Hegel, it is described by Marx as Capital and its self-valorization. It is not, Postone suggests, similar to Lukacs' use of Hegel, wherein the proletariat are identified as Spirit, for then spirit would be labour not emancipation.          It is from this concept that we can build a radical critique of the commodity, money, value, labor and politics, that is to say, a critique that is not limited to describe the struggles around management and distribution, the ""class struggle"" as traditionally understood, but recognizing that these categories themselves are problematic: they are specific only to capitalist modernity, and are responsible for its destructive and self-destructive nature. Pointing out that the market is a mere mechanism of distribution, and so is secondary to the core of capitalism allows Postone to broaden the historical scope of Marx's theory and so it can, with equal validity, be applied to what was the USSR. In the USSR the main difference was that instead of a market handling distribution it was planners; however, the abstract exchange of labour, which is the core of capitalism for Postone, was as it was in the West.          In his 1986 article, Anti-Semitism and National Socialism, Moishe Postone developed new thinking on modern anti-Semitism, and particularly on National Socialist ideology. Postone sees it as a major element in the development of a socio-historical theory of consciousness determined by social forms that are subjected to socialization under capitalism. What is said about modern anti-Semitism may also describe a trend of vulgar anti-capitalism that seeks the personification of the elements of capitalism that are so hated.          Postone shows that modern anti-Semitism is very different from most forms of racism and Christian anti-Semitism. It differs from them because it casts a huge global invisible power of international Jewery, it is the idea of a global conspiracy that is intrinsic to modern anti-Semitism. Postone analyzes anti-Semitism against the Marxian notion of dual character of the commodity category. And he observes that the characteristics that distinguishes anti-Semitism among the Jews are the same as for the value: abstraction, invisibility, automation, impersonal domination. Postone argues that the form of socialization under capitalism (the historically specific function of the spirit of labour under capitalism) makes it possible to separate the concrete (as socially ""natural"" sound, true, etc..).          This opposition between the concrete and the abstract determined by social forms, pervades all forms of subjectivity, and thus helps to understand a central feature of the National Socialist ideology. Because this ideology was not fundamentally anti-modern and it would be wrong to label it as such. It is true that claimed the defense of the peasantry and craftsmanship, but also said the modern technological and industrial production. Nazism was rather a vulgar form of anti-capitalism. The rejection of the bourgeoisie and its values is present in Nazism. There is more sense to see the Nazi ideology as the affirmation of the concrete dimension - which includes technology and industrial production, as well as the peasantry and manual labor - as heart healthy social life, organic, and it against the abstract dimension materialized by finance capital. The abstract is instead rejected - and it is personified by the Jews. Postone analyzes the figure of the Jew in the modern anti-Semitism as the embodiment of abstract value and extermination camps can be interpreted as a misbegotten notion of a ""factory"" to destroy value.","['1942 births', 'Living people', 'American historians', 'American people of Canadian-Jewish descent', 'Jewish American historians', 'University of Chicago faculty']"

He was the older brother of gang member Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer, one of the series' most popular and best-remembered characters.          Switzer was born in Paris, Illinois, the first son of Gladys C. Shanks and George Frederick Switzer. He and younger brother Carl became famous around their hometown for their musical talent and performances; both sang and played a number of instruments.          The Switzers took a trip to California in 1934 to visit with family members. While sightseeing they eventually wound up at Hal Roach Studios. Following a public tour of the facility, 8-year-old Harold and 6-year-old Carl entered into the Hal Roach Studio's public cafeteria, the ""Our Gang"" Café, and began an impromptu performance. Producer Hal Roach was present at the commissary that day and was impressed by the performance. He signed both Switzers to appear in ""Our Gang"". Harold was given two nicknames, ""Slim"" and ""Deadpan,"" and Carl was dubbed ""Alfalfa.""          The Switzer brothers first appeared in the 1935 ""Our Gang"" short, ""Beginner's Luck"". By the end of the year, Carl was one of the main characters in the series, while Harold had more or less been relegated to the role of a background player. Both Carl and Harold outgrew the series by 1940, with Slim's last appearance in ""The New Pupil"".          Though not saddled with the same problems his younger brother was faced with due to being typecast as a ""child star,"" Harold had his own problems. For several years, he operated a Speed Queen Company franchise, installing and servicing washers and dryers. In 1967, after killing a customer over a dispute, Switzer drove himself to a remote area near Glendale, California and committed suicide. He was 42.          Harold ""Slim"" Switzer is interred at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood, California, alongside his brother Carl.          Swtizer was married to Beverly Osso for over 10 years. The union brought three children: Judith Ann, Tony Frederick and Teddy Berton.

6592,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6592,Cyclades,"The Cyclades (; , ) are an island group in the Aegean Sea, southeast of mainland Greece and a former administrative prefecture of Greece. They are one of the island groups which constitute the Aegean archipelago. The name refers to the islands ""around"" (κυκλάς) the sacred island of Delos. The Cyclades is where the native Greek breed of cat (the Aegean cat) originated.          The significant Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age Cycladic culture is best known for its schematic, flat idols carved out of the islands' pure white marble centuries before the great Middle Bronze Age (""Minoan"") culture arose in Crete, to the south: these figures have been looted from burials to satisfy a thriving Cycladic antiquities market since the early 20th century.          A distinctive Neolithic culture amalgamating Anatolian and mainland Greek elements arose in the western Aegean before 4000 BCE, based on emmer wheat and wild-type barley, sheep and goats, pigs, and tuna that were apparently speared from small boats (Rutter). Excavated sites include Saliagos and Kephala (on Keos) with signs of copper-working, Each of the small Cycladic islands could support no more than a few thousand people, though Late Cycladic boat models show that fifty oarsmen could be assembled from the scattered communities (Rutter), and when the highly organized palace-culture of Crete arose, the islands faded into insignificance, with the exception of Delos, which retained its archaic reputation as a sanctuary throughout antiquity and until the emergence of Christianity.          The first archaeological excavations of the 1880s were followed by systematic work by the British School at Athens and by Christos Tsountas, who investigated burial sites on several islands in 1898–1899 and coined the term ""Cycladic civilization"". Interest lagged, then picked up in the mid-20th century, as collectors competed for the modern-looking figures that seemed so similar to sculpture by Jean Arp or Constantin Brâncuși. Sites were looted and a brisk trade in forgeries arose. The context for many of these Cycladic figurines has been mostly destroyed and their meaning may never be completely understood. Another intriguing and mysterious object is that of the Cycladic frying pans. More accurate archaeology has revealed the broad outlines of a farming and seafaring culture that had immigrated from Asia Minor c. 5000 BCE. Early Cycladic culture evolved in three phases, between c.  3300 – 2000 BCE, when it was increasingly swamped in the rising influence of Minoan Crete. The culture of mainland Greece contemporary with Cycladic culture is called Helladic culture.          In recent decades the Cyclades islands have become popular with European and other tourists, and as a result there have been problems with erosion, pollution, and water shortages.          The Cyclades comprise about 220 islands, the major ones being Amorgos, Anafi, Andros, Antiparos, Delos, Eschati, Ios, Kea, Kimolos, Kythnos, Milos, Mykonos, Naxos, Paros, Folegandros, Serifos, Sifnos, Sikinos, Syros, Tinos, and Thira or Santoríni. The name ""Cyclades"" refers to the islands forming a circle (""circular islands"") around the sacred island of Delos. Most of the smaller islands are uninhabited.          Ermoupolis, on Syros, is the chief town and administrative center of the former prefecture.          The islands are peaks of a submerged mountainous terrain, with the exception of two volcanic islands, Milos and Santorini. The climate is generally dry and mild, but with the exception of Naxos the soil is not very fertile; agricultural produce includes wine, fruit, wheat, olive oil, and tobacco. Cooler temperatures are in higher elevations and mainly do not receive wintry weather.          The Cyclades are bounded to the south by the Sea of Crete.          The Cyclades Prefecture () was one of the prefectures of Greece. As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the prefecture was abolished, and its territory was divided into nine regional units of the South Aegean region:          The prefecture was subdivided into the following municipalities and communities. These have been reorganised at the 2011 Kallikratis reform as well.           ""Note:"" Provinces no longer hold any legal status in Greece.

He is best remembered for having passed strictures against the sitting Peshwa of the time for instigating murder. Ram Shastri's integrity in public affairs is regarded as a model for all times.          Ramshastri Prabhune was born in the small town of Mahuli, near Satara. Little is known of his early life, with references to him being available only after he entered the service of the Peshwas.          Ram Shastri held office under the Peshwas during the latter part of the 18th century. Known for his honesty and integrity, he even declined a royal gift made to his wife. He turned down the offer of an official mansion and continued to live in his humble ancestral home in the Brahmin quarter of Poona city on his modest income. It is said that his wife sold milk from their two cows and a buffalo in order to supplement his monthly income. This Brahminical frugality complemented his wide and eclectic scholarship: he was renowned for his knowledge of law (including British law), philosophy, and the theories of statecraft and political science. He was proficient in the Sanskrit, Marathi, Hindi, Urdu and English languages. As a young Brahmin student of Advaita vedanta, he had studied the Vedas, Upanishads and Puranas and was so well-versed in the Hindu scriptures, that he was considered as an authority in Pune in those times. He once debated for five days with Shri Varadendra Teertha, pontiff of the Madhva sect. After the debate, as a mark of respect and tribute to the scholarship of the pontiff he gave up his house and the structure is surviving to this day as the Shri Varadendra Swamy Mutt on Laxmi Road in Pune. To this theological scholarship, he added in later life a reading of the Quran and the Bible.          Ram Shastri's most famous act of passing the death sentence on the ruling Peshwa of the time, Raghunath Rao, for the murder of his own nephew, Peshwa Narayan Rao. In 1772, Peshwa Madhavrao I died, leaving his brother Narayan Rao, a minor, as heir. Madhavrao's paternal uncle, Peshwa Raghunath Rao, was appointed regent in the minority of his nephew. The following year, an act infamous in the history of the Maratha Empire was perpetrated when the young boy was murdered, at the behest either of the Regent or of his wife Anandibai, by Raghunath Rao's guardsmen. On the quiet winter night of 17 December 1772, the assassins entered his private quarters at Shaniwarwada in Pune; the boy-Peshwa ran for safety to the apartments of his uncle and aunt, knowing little about the true origin of the plot. These guardsmen then committed the murder in the very presence of Raghunath Rao and Anandibai.          Narayan Rao's wife delivered a son shortly after the death of her husband.

The name of the grenade came from Sidol, a metal-cleaning agent from Henkel sold in Poland at the time. The first grenades used the Sidol bottles as the casing. Later on the casing was purposely modelled after the bottle in order to allow for easier hiding of the weapon.           Sidolówka was first produced in Warsaw in 1942, by the professors of the Warsaw University of Technology under the leadership of Jan Czochralski. It was partially based on an earlier design of the Filipinka grenade, also of underground construction, which in turn was based on a pre-war Polish ET-38 anti-tank grenade. The primer and the detonator were designed by two engineers of the pre-war Polish munition works in Warsaw, pyrotechnician Władysław Pankowski and engineer Józef Michałowski.          It was a fragmentation grenade with a P-42 friction primer and a 4.5 second delay time. Until the end of the World War II, an estimate of 350,000 R-42 were produced in Polish underground factories.

1130361,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1130361,Running Wild (band),"Running Wild is a German heavy metal band, formed in 1976 in Hamburg. They were part of the German metal scene to emerge in the early to mid-1980s. Over the course of their career, they have released fifteen studio albums, three live albums, five compilation albums, and six singles/EPs. Although their earlier releases contained Satanic themes and imagery, Gerald ""Preacher"" Warnecke, the guitar player of the band, was studying theology at the time and is now a vicar in Cologne.          In 1987, the band released the album ""Under Jolly Roger,"" which was a switch to pirate-based and historical themes, creating and influencing the later named Pirate metal subgenre of heavy metal in the 2000s in the process. While the historical lyrics were very superficial at first, the lyrics for later albums were intensively researched, by Rolf Kasparek in particular.          After this album, from 1988 to 1992 (for the albums ""Port Royal"", ""Death or Glory"", ""Blazon Stone"" and ""Pile of Skulls""), Running Wild mainly wrote historically based lyrics. In addition to lyrics about pirates like Calico Jack, Klaus Störtebeker, or the little-known Henry Jennings, the band also addressed subjects like the Wars of the Roses, the Battle of Waterloo, or the colonization of the New World by the Conquistadors.          On 17 April 2009 Rolf announced that Running Wild had split up. Their intended last show was at Wacken Open Air on July 30, 2009. It was recorded for CD and DVD release and appeared as ""The Final Jolly Roger"" on June 24, 2011.          As of 21 October 2011, Running Wild have reformed. Their most recent album, titled ""Resilient"", was released in October 2013.          Running Wild played live for the Wacken Open Air festival in July of 2015.

23129431,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23129431,Cognitive appraisal,"Cognitive appraisal is the personal interpretation of a situation; it is how an individual views a situation. ""Appraisals refer to direct, immediate, and intuitive evaluations made on the environment in reference to personal well-being."" They are ""evaluative frameworks that people utilize to make sense of events."" Appraisals provide a glimpse of how people subjectively experience their environments and are strong correlates of emotions.          Cognitive appraisal is regarded by some sport psychologists as an important component of burnout. The perception of a situation can be the cause of a negative psychological reaction, rather than the situation itself. An athlete who loses a string of competitions can view it positively as a challenge and an opportunity to come back from adversity, or view it negatively as evidence that he or she will never be a successful competitor.          Cognitive appraisals determine if an event will be perceived as stressful. When distress is high, some individuals may be motivated to enter psychotherapy, and some psychotherapists may explicitly target cognitive appraisals when providing treatment. Per Dienes, Torres-Harding, Reinecke, Freeman, and Sauer (2011), “cognitive therapies . . . focus on an individual’s beliefs about the self, the world, and the future. The sources of pathology, and therefore the targets of therapy, are thoughts – maladaptive cognitions – that are frequently automatic and ingrained”. When maladaptive cognitive appraisals are thought to cause or maintain distress, impairment, or psychopathology, therapists may assist clients to question the evidence related to an appraisal, notice when irrational fantasies about potential consequences of some situation are linked to the experience of distress or impairment, and begin to respond to these situations in a more rational manner.          Patterns of emotion have long been researched with an interest in describing emotional experiences in terms of underlying dimensions. Traditionally theorists have only looked into two dimensions, pleasantness and arousal. With the review of two theorists, Roseman and Scherer, there has been a new proposal of a now eight cognitive appraisal dimensions to distinguish emotional understanding. “Most people refer to emotions in categorical terms: ‘I was scared’ or ‘I was sad’.” Most categorical theorists explain emotions as unstructured collections of distinct beings and, therefore, fail to capture the similarities and differences of emotions. A dimensional view of emotions is not incompatible with a categorical view. “Interrelations among emotions are not new. In 1896 Wundt proposed a three-dimensional structure of emotions, and in 1941 Schlosber began a series of investigations into the structural interrelations among emotions.” Pleasantness and level of activation (or arousal) are the only dimensions that have been found consistently across studies.           There have been studies done on categorical and dimensional factors, but a third group of theorists identify with neither approach. They argue that emotional differences must undeniably involve differences in the way an organism appraises its environment. The descriptions of the individual emotions demonstrate that that each emotion is characterized by a unique pattern of cognitive appraisals. Theorists must take into consideration all three patters and the role that each cognitive appraisal (dimension, categorical or environmental) plays in distinguishing among emotions.           1.Valence: positive vs. negative           2.Activation: aroused vs. relaxed          The term appraisal rebound effects refers to the stronger activation of an appraisal as a result of trying to suppress it. At times appraisal rebounds effects can continue psychopathological symptoms. An example of this can be when patients with stress try to remove negative thoughts from their mind but fail to do so and observe the disorder symptoms appearing on the same scale or even greater at times.          Wegner hypothesizes that suppressing appraisals involve two mechanisms. The first is the conscious suppression of the appraisal and seeking distractors to avoid appraisal. The second mechanism is the unconscious process of searching for the appraisal, and when finding one, it alerts the conscious mechanism to find more distractors. This process requires too much cognitive resources, and so the distractors often fail, and the appraisal can become hyperaccessible, perpetuating the appraisal.          Chronic appraisals are related to the chronic emotions of individuals since the way they chronically perceive situations affect their emotions. When individuals who tend to appraise situations in negative ways try to suppress the appraisal, they will be more likely to appraise another event negatively as well, and perpetuate their negative emotions.          The appraisal view of stress was developed by Richard Lazarus. He suggested that an individual's stress level is directly affected by their cognitive appraisal of the event that triggers the stress.          There are two stages of cognitive appraisal:          Primary appraisals. The initial evaluation of the situation comprises an assessment of the threat in the present situation.          Three kinds can be distinguished:          When an event is perceived as negative in the primary appraisal process, the individual moves to stage 2.          Evaluation of the individual's ability to cope with a situation, and of whether or not the individual has the materials to deal with the stimulus causing the stress. Secondary appraisal interacts with the primary appraisal to determine the emotional reaction to event.          This further appraisal is made in regard to:          During stage 2, if the individual finds that they do not have the materials to cope with the stimulus causing stress, it will determine the level of stress that is experienced. An example of this would be the reaction to snakes, which shows a great variation. A harmless garter snake might cause fear in some people and nothing in others.          Afterward, reappraisals occur: a continuous re-evaluation of the situation based on new information.          Cognitive responses to stress include beliefs          Some responses to stress are a conscious effort to cope with the stress.          Steve Williams suggests top professional golfers do not morally judge a shot after it comes to rest. According to Williams:          ""In the top golfers' eyes all shots are equal, and none is more equal that the others --- something that fits nicely into my native Kiwi egalitarianism. And since all golf shots are equal,there's no point in making value judgements on them. The top golfers just gather the data, and deliberately suppress any tendency to be either encouraged or discouraged by it. It's just data: it doesn't have a moral value.""          This statement suggest that top athlete's use cognitive appraisal to devalue a particular situation or outcome neither judging it being good or bad. A situation or in this case, a singular golf shot, is what it is and nothing else. In professional golf, if the player were to allow a previous shot to dictate emotional levels, that player would experience a roller coaster of emotions on every hole since no shot, other than a hole in one, is considered perfect. By removing emotion and not placing a judgmental value on performance, like a particulate golf shot, the athlete is not held hostage psychologically by up and down swings in athletic performance or outcomes that sometimes are out of the athlete's control.",['Psychology articles needing attention']

1640,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1640,Alfred the Great,"Alfred the Great (849 – 26 October 899) (, ""elf counsel"" or ""wise elf"") was King of Wessex from 871 to 899.          Alfred successfully defended his kingdom against the Viking attempt at conquest, and by the time of his death had become the dominant ruler in England. He is one of only two English monarchs to be given the epithet ""the Great"", the other being the Scandinavian Cnut the Great. He was also the first King of the West Saxons to style himself ""King of the Anglo-Saxons"". Details of Alfred's life are described in a work by the 10th-century Welsh scholar and bishop Asser. Alfred had a reputation as a learned and merciful man of a gracious and level-headed nature who encouraged education and improved his kingdom's legal system, military structure and his people's quality of life.          Alfred was born in the village of Wanating, now Wantage, Oxfordshire. He was the youngest son of King Æthelwulf of Wessex, by his first wife, Osburh.          In 853, at the age of four, Alfred is said to have been sent to Rome where, according to the ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"". he was confirmed by Pope Leo IV who ""anointed him as king"". Victorian writers later interpreted this as an anticipatory coronation in preparation for his eventual succession to the throne of Wessex. However, his succession could not have been foreseen at the time, as Alfred had three living elder brothers. A letter of Leo IV shows that Alfred was made a ""consul""; a misinterpretation of this investiture, deliberate or accidental, could explain later confusion. It may also be based on Alfred's later having accompanied his father on a pilgrimage to Rome, where he spent some time at the court of Charles the Bald, King of the Franks, around 854–855.          On their return from Rome in 856, Æthelwulf was deposed by his son Æthelbald. With civil war looming, the magnates of the realm met in council to hammer out a compromise. Æthelbald would retain the western shires (i.e. historical Wessex), and Æthelwulf would rule in the east. When King Æthelwulf died in 858, Wessex was ruled by three of Alfred's brothers in succession: Æthelbald, Æthelberht and Æthelred.          Bishop Asser tells the story of how as a child Alfred won as a prize a book of Saxon poems, offered by his mother to the first of her children able to memorize it. Legend also has it that the young Alfred spent time in Ireland seeking healing. Alfred was troubled by health problems throughout his life. It is thought that he may have suffered from Crohn's disease. Statues of Alfred in Winchester and Wantage portray him as a great warrior. Evidence suggests he was not physically strong, and though not lacking in courage, he was noted more for his intellect than as a warlike character.          During the short reigns of the older two of his three elder brothers, Æthelbald of Wessex and Æthelberht of Wessex, Alfred is not mentioned. An army of Danes which the ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"" described as the Great Heathen Army had landed in East Anglia with the intent of conquering the four kingdoms that constituted Anglo-Saxon England in 865. It was with the backdrop of a rampaging Viking army that Alfred's public life began, with the accession of his third brother, Æthelred of Wessex, in 865.          During this period, Bishop Asser applied to Alfred the unique title of ""secundarius"", which may indicate a position akin to that of the Celtic ""tanist"", a recognised successor closely associated with the reigning monarch. This arrangement may have been sanctioned by Alfred's father, or by the Witan, to guard against the danger of a disputed succession should Æthelred fall in battle. The arrangement of crowning a successor as royal prince and military commander is well known among other Germanic tribes, such as the Swedes and Franks, to whom the Anglo-Saxons were closely related.          In 868, Alfred is recorded as fighting beside Æthelred in an unsuccessful attempt to keep the Great Heathen Army, led by Ivar the Boneless, out of the adjoining Kingdom of Mercia. At the end of 870, the Danes arrived in his homeland. The year which followed has been called ""Alfred's year of battles"". Nine engagements were fought, with varying outcomes, though the places and dates of two of these battles have not been recorded.          In Berkshire, a successful skirmish at the Battle of Englefield on 31 December 870 was followed by a severe defeat at the siege and Battle of Reading by Ivar's brother Halfdan Ragnarsson on 5 January 871. Four days later, the Anglo-Saxons won a brilliant victory at the Battle of Ashdown on the Berkshire Downs, possibly near Compton or Aldworth. Alfred is particularly credited with the success of this last battle.          Later that month, on 22 January, the Saxons were defeated at the Battle of Basing. They were defeated again on 22 March at the Battle of Merton (perhaps Marden in Wiltshire or Martin in Dorset). Æthelred died shortly afterwards on 23 April.          In April 871, King Æthelred died, and Alfred succeeded to the throne of Wessex and the burden of its defence, even though Æthelred left two under-age sons, Æthelhelm and Æthelwold. This was in accordance with the agreement that Æthelred and Alfred had made earlier that year in an assembly at ""Swinbeorg"". The brothers had agreed that whichever of them outlived the other would inherit the personal property that King Æthelwulf had left jointly to his sons in his will. The deceased's sons would receive only whatever property and riches their father had settled upon them and whatever additional lands their uncle had acquired. The unstated premise was that the surviving brother would be king. Given the ongoing Danish invasion and the youth of his nephews, Alfred's accession probably went uncontested.          While he was busy with the burial ceremonies for his brother, the Danes defeated the Saxon army in his absence at an unnamed spot, and then again in his presence at Wilton in May. The defeat at Wilton smashed any remaining hope that Alfred could drive the invaders from his kingdom. He was forced instead to make peace with them, according to sources that do not tell what the terms of the peace were. Bishop Asser claimed that the 'pagans' agreed to vacate the realm and made good their promise.          Indeed, the Viking army did withdraw from Reading in the autumn of 871 to take up winter quarters in Mercian London. Although not mentioned by Asser or by the ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"", Alfred probably also paid the Vikings cash to leave, much as the Mercians were to do in the following year. Hoards dating to the Viking occupation of London in 871/2 have been excavated at Croydon, Gravesend, and Waterloo Bridge. These finds hint at the cost involved in making peace with the Vikings. For the next five years, the Danes occupied other parts of England.          In 876 under their new leader, Guthrum, the Danes slipped past the Saxon army and attacked and occupied Wareham in Dorset. Alfred blockaded them but was unable to take Wareham by assault. Accordingly, he negotiated a peace which involved an exchange of hostages and oaths, which the Danes swore on a ""holy ring"" associated with the worship of Thor. The Danes, however, broke their word and, after killing all the hostages, slipped away under cover of night to Exeter in Devon.          Alfred blockaded the Viking ships in Devon, and with a relief fleet having been scattered by a storm, the Danes were forced to submit. The Danes withdrew to Mercia. In January 878, the Danes made a sudden attack on Chippenham, a royal stronghold in which Alfred had been staying over Christmas, ""and most of the people they killed, except the King Alfred, and he with a little band made his way by wood and swamp, and after Easter he made a fort at Athelney in the marshes of Somerset, and from that fort kept fighting against the foe"". From his fort at Athelney, an island in the marshes near North Petherton, Alfred was able to mount an effective resistance movement, rallying the local militias from Somerset, Wiltshire and Hampshire.          A legend, originating from 12th century chronicles, tells how when he first fled to the Somerset Levels, Alfred was given shelter by a peasant woman who, unaware of his identity, left him to watch some cakes she had left cooking on the fire. Preoccupied with the problems of his kingdom, Alfred accidentally let the cakes burn, and was roundly scolded by the woman upon her return.          878 was the low-water mark in the history of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. With all the other kingdoms having fallen to the Vikings, Wessex alone was still resisting.          In the seventh week after Easter (4–10 May 878), around Whitsuntide, Alfred rode to 'Egbert's Stone' east of Selwood, where he was met by ""all the people of Somerset and of Wiltshire and of that part of Hampshire which is on this side of the sea (that is, west of Southampton Water), and they rejoiced to see him"". Alfred's emergence from his marshland stronghold was part of a carefully planned offensive that entailed raising the fyrds of three shires. This meant not only that the king had retained the loyalty of ealdormen, royal reeves and king's thegns (who were charged with levying and leading these forces), but that they had maintained their positions of authority in these localities well enough to answer his summons to war. Alfred's actions also suggest a system of scouts and messengers.          Alfred won a decisive victory in the ensuing Battle of Edington which may have been fought near Westbury, Wiltshire. He then pursued the Danes to their stronghold at Chippenham and starved them into submission. One of the terms of the surrender was that Guthrum convert to Christianity. Three weeks later the Danish king and 29 of his chief men were baptised at Alfred's court at Aller, near Athelney, with Alfred receiving Guthrum as his spiritual son.          According to Asser:          The unbinding of the Chrisom took place with great ceremony eight days later at the royal estate at Wedmore           While at Wedmore Alfred and Guthrum negotiated what some historians have called the Treaty of Wedmore, however it was to be some years after the ceasing of hostilities that a formal treaty was actually signed. . Under the terms of the so-called Treaty of Wedmore, the converted Guthrum was required to leave Wessex and return to East Anglia. Consequently, in 879 the Viking army left Chippenham and made its way to Cirencester. The formal Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum, preserved in Old English in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (Manuscript 383), and in a Latin compilation known as ""Quadripartitus"", was negotiated later, perhaps in 879 or 880, when King Ceolwulf II of Mercia was deposed.          That treaty divided up the kingdom of Mercia. By its terms the boundary between Alfred's and Guthrum's kingdoms was to run up the River Thames, to the River Lea; follow the Lea to its source (near Luton); from there extend in a straight line to Bedford; and from Bedford follow the River Ouse to Watling Street.          In other words, Alfred succeeded to Ceolwulf's kingdom, consisting of western Mercia; and Guthrum incorporated the eastern part of Mercia into an enlarged kingdom of East Anglia (henceforward known as the Danelaw). By terms of the treaty, moreover, Alfred was to have control over the Mercian city of London and its mints—at least for the time being. The disposition of Essex, held by West Saxon kings since the days of Egbert, is unclear from the treaty, though, given Alfred's political and military superiority, it would have been surprising if he had conceded any disputed territory to his new godson.          With the signing of the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum, an event most commonly held to have taken place around 880 when Guthrum's people began settling East Anglia, Guthrum was neutralised as a threat. The Viking army, that had stayed at Fulham during the Winter of 878-879, sailed for Ghent and was active on the continent from 879-892.          Alfred was still forced to contend with a number of Danish threats. A year later, in 881, Alfred fought a small sea battle against four Danish ships ""on the high seas"". Two of the ships were destroyed and the others surrendered to Alfred's forces. Similar small skirmishes with independent Viking raiders would have occurred for much of the period as they had for decades.          In the year 883, though there is some debate over the year, King Alfred, because of his support and his donation of alms to Rome, received a number of gifts from Pope Marinus. Among these gifts was reputed to be a piece of the true cross, a true treasure for the devout Saxon king. According to Asser, because of Pope Marinus' friendship with King Alfred, the pope granted an exemption to any Anglo-Saxons residing within Rome from tax or tribute.          After the signing of the treaty with Guthrum, Alfred was spared any large-scale conflicts for some time. Despite this relative peace, the king was still forced to deal with a number of Danish raids and incursions. Among these was a raid in Kent, an allied kingdom in South East England, during the year 885, which was quite possibly the largest raid since the battles with Guthrum. Asser's account of the raid places the Danish raiders at the Saxon city of Rochester, where they built a temporary fortress in order to besiege the city. In response to this incursion, Alfred led an Anglo-Saxon force against the Danes who, instead of engaging the army of Wessex, fled to their beached ships and sailed to another part of Britain. The retreating Danish force supposedly left Britain the following summer.          Not long after the failed Danish raid in Kent, Alfred dispatched his fleet to East Anglia. The purpose of this expedition is debated, though Asser claims that it was for the sake of plunder. After travelling up the River Stour, the fleet was met by Danish vessels that numbered 13 or 16 (sources vary on the number) and a battle ensued. The Anglo-Saxon fleet emerged victorious and as Huntingdon accounts, ""laden with spoils"". The victorious fleet was then caught unawares when attempting to leave the River Stour, and was attacked by a Danish force at the mouth of the river. The Danish fleet defeated Alfred's fleet, which may have been weakened in the previous engagement.          A year later, in 886, Alfred reoccupied the city of London and set out to make it habitable again. Alfred entrusted the city to the care of his son-in-law Æthelred, ealdorman of Mercia. The restoration of London progressed through the latter half of the 880s and is believed to have revolved around a new street plan; added fortifications in addition to the existing Roman walls; and, some believe, the construction of matching fortifications on the south bank of the River Thames.          This is also the period in which almost all chroniclers agree that the Saxon people of pre-unification England submitted to Alfred. This was not, however, the point at which Alfred came to be known as King of England; in fact he would never adopt the title for himself.           Between the restoration of London and the resumption of large scale Danish attacks in the early 890s, Alfred's reign was rather uneventful. The relative peace of the late 880s was marred by the death of Alfred's sister, Æthelswith, en route to Rome in 888. In the same year the Archbishop of Canterbury, Æthelred, also died. One year later Guthrum, or Athelstan by his baptismal name, Alfred's former enemy and king of East Anglia, died and was buried in Hadleigh, Suffolk.          Guthrum's passing changed the political landscape for Alfred. The resulting power vacuum stirred up other power–hungry warlords eager to take his place in the following years. The quiet years of Alfred's life were coming to a close, and war was on the horizon.          After another lull, in the autumn of 892 or 893, the Danes attacked again. Finding their position in mainland Europe precarious, they crossed to England in 330 ships in two divisions. They entrenched themselves, the larger body at Appledore, Kent, and the lesser, under Hastein, at Milton, also in Kent. The invaders brought their wives and children with them, indicating a meaningful attempt at conquest and colonisation. Alfred, in 893 or 894, took up a position from which he could observe both forces.          While he was in talks with Hastein, the Danes at Appledore broke out and struck northwestwards. They were overtaken by Alfred's eldest son, Edward, and were defeated in a general engagement at Farnham in Surrey. They took refuge on an island at Thorney, on the River Colne between Buckinghamshire and Middlesex, where they were blockaded and forced to give hostages and promise to leave Wessex. They then went to Essex and, after suffering another defeat at Benfleet, joined with Hastein's force at Shoebury.          Alfred had been on his way to relieve his son at Thorney when he heard that the Northumbrian and East Anglian Danes were besieging Exeter and an unnamed stronghold on the North Devon shore. Alfred at once hurried westward and raised the Siege of Exeter. The fate of the other place is not recorded.          Meanwhile, the force under Hastein set out to march up the Thames Valley, possibly with the idea of assisting their friends in the west. They were met by a large force under the three great ealdormen of Mercia, Wiltshire and Somerset, and forced to head off to the northwest, being finally overtaken and blockaded at Buttington. (Some identify this with Buttington Tump at the mouth of the River Wye, others with Buttington near Welshpool.) An attempt to break through the English lines was defeated. Those who escaped retreated to Shoebury. After collecting reinforcements, they made a sudden dash across England and occupied the ruined Roman walls of Chester. The English did not attempt a winter blockade, but contented themselves with destroying all the supplies in the district.          Early in 894 or 895, lack of food obliged the Danes to retire once more to Essex. At the end of the year, the Danes drew their ships up the River Thames and River Lea and fortified themselves twenty miles (32 km) north of London. A direct attack on the Danish lines failed but, later in the year, Alfred saw a means of obstructing the river so as to prevent the egress of the Danish ships. The Danes realised that they were outmanoeuvred. They struck off north-westwards and wintered at Cwatbridge near Bridgnorth. The next year, 896 (or 897), they gave up the struggle. Some retired to Northumbria, some to East Anglia. Those who had no connections in England withdrew back to the continent.          The Germanic tribes who invaded Britain in the fifth and sixth centuries relied upon the unarmoured infantry supplied by their tribal levy, or fyrd, and it was upon this system that the military power of the several kingdoms of early Anglo-Saxon England depended. The fyrd was a local militia in the Anglo-Saxon shire, in which all freemen had to serve; those who refused military service were subject to fines or loss of their land.          According to the law code of King Ine of Wessex, issued in about 694:          Wessex's history of failures preceding his success in 878 emphasised to Alfred that the traditional system of battle he had inherited played to the Danes' advantage. While both the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes attacked settlements to seize wealth and other resources, they employed very different strategies. In their raids, the Anglo-Saxons traditionally preferred to attack head-on by assembling their forces in a shield wall, advancing against their target and overcoming the oncoming wall marshaled against them in defence.          In contrast, the Danes preferred to choose easy targets, mapping cautious forays designed to avoid risking all their accumulated plunder with high-stake attacks for more. Alfred determined their strategy was to launch smaller scaled attacks from a secure and reinforced defensible base to which they could retreat should their raiders meet strong resistance.          These bases were prepared in advance, often by capturing an estate and augmenting its defences with surrounding ditches, ramparts and palisades. Once inside the fortification, Alfred realised, the Danes enjoyed the advantage, better situated to outlast their opponents or crush them with a counter-attack as the provisions and stamina of the besieging forces waned.          The means by which the Anglo-Saxons marshaled forces to defend against marauders also left them vulnerable to the Vikings. It was the responsibility of the shire fyrd to deal with local raids. The king could call up the national militia to defend the kingdom; however, in the case of hit and run raids by Vikings, problems with communication and raising supplies meant that the national militia could not be mustered quickly enough: It was only after the raids were underway that a call went out to landowners to gather men for battle. Large regions could be devastated before the newly assembled fyrd arrived. And although the landowners were obliged to the king to supply these men when called, during the attacks in 878, many of them opportunistically abandoned their king and collaborated with Guthrum.          With these lessons in mind, Alfred capitalised on the relatively peaceful years immediately following his victory at Edington by focusing on an ambitious restructuring of his kingdom's military defences. On a trip to Rome, Alfred had stayed with Charles the Bald and it is possible that he may have studied how the Carolingian kings had dealt with the Viking problem, and learning from their experience was able to put together a system of taxation and defence for his own kingdom. Also, there had been a system of fortifications in pre-Viking Mercia that may have been an influence. So when the Viking raids resumed in 892, Alfred was better prepared to confront them with a standing, mobile field army, a network of garrisons, and a small fleet of ships navigating the rivers and estuaries.          Tenants in Anglo-Saxon England had a threefold obligation based on their landholding; the so-called ""common burdens"" of military service, fortress work, and bridge repair. This threefold obligation has traditionally been called ""trinoda neccessitas"" or ""trimoda neccessitas"". The Old English name for the fine due for neglecting military service was ""fierdwite"" or ""fyrdwitee"".          To maintain the burhs, and to reorganize the fyrd as a standing army, Alfred expanded the tax and conscription system based on the productivity of a tenant's landholding. The hide was the basic unit of the system on which the tenant's public obligations were assessed. A hide is thought to represent the amount of land required to support one family. The hide would differ in size according to the value and resources of the land and the landowner would have to provide service based on how many hides he owned.          At the centre of Alfred's reformed military defence system was the network of burhs, distributed at strategic points throughout the kingdom. There were thirty-three in total, spaced approximately apart, enabling the military to confront attacks anywhere in the kingdom within a single day.          Alfred's burhs (later termed boroughs) ranged from former Roman towns, such as Winchester, where the stone walls were repaired and ditches added, to massive earthen walls surrounded by wide ditches probably reinforced with wooden revetments and palisades such as at Burpham, Sussex. The size of the burhs ranged from tiny outposts such as Pilton to large fortifications in established towns, the largest at Winchester.          A contemporary document now known as the Burghal Hidage provides an insight into how the system worked. It lists the hidage for each of the fortified towns contained in the document. For example, Wallingford had a hidage of 2400 which meant that the landowners there were responsible for supplying and feeding 2,400 men, the number sufficient for maintaining of wall. A total of 27,071 soldiers were needed system wide, or approximately one in four of all the free men in Wessex.          Many of the burhs were twin towns that straddled a river and connected by a fortified bridge, like those built by Charles the Bald a generation before. The double-burh blocked passage on the river, forcing Viking ships to navigate under a garrisoned bridge lined with men armed with stones, spears, or arrows. Other burhs were sited near fortified royal villas allowing the king better control over his strongholds.          The burhs were also interconnected by a road system maintained for army use (known as ""herepaths""). These roads would allow an army to be quickly assembled sometimes from more than one burh to confront the Viking invader. This network posed significant obstacles to Viking invaders, especially those laden with booty. The system threatened Viking routes and communications making it far more dangerous for the Viking raiders. However, the Vikings lacked both the equipment necessary to undertake a siege against the burh and a developed doctrine of siegecraft, having tailored their methods of fighting to rapid strikes and unimpeded retreats to well defended fortifications. The only means left to them was to starve the burh into submission, but this allowed the king time to send assistance with his mobile field army or garrisons from neighbouring burhs along the well maintained army roads. In such cases, the Vikings were extremely vulnerable to pursuit by the king's joint military forces. Alfred's burh system posed such a formidable challenge against Viking attack that when the Vikings returned in 892 and successfully stormed a half-made, poorly garrisoned fortress up the Lympne estuary in Kent, the Anglo-Saxons were able to limit their penetration to the outer frontiers of Wessex and Mercia          Alfred's burghal system was revolutionary in its strategic conception and potentially expensive in its execution. His contemporary biographer Asser wrote that many nobles balked at the new demands placed upon them even though they were for ""the common needs of the kingdom"".          Alfred also tried his hand at naval design. In 896, he ordered the construction of a small fleet, perhaps a dozen or so longships, that, at 60 oars, were twice the size of Viking warships. This was not, as the Victorians asserted, the birth of the English Navy. Wessex possessed a royal fleet before this. King Athelstan of Kent and Ealdorman Ealhhere had defeated a Viking fleet in 851, capturing nine ships, and Alfred himself had conducted naval actions in 882.          But, clearly, the author of the ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"" and probably Alfred himself regarded 897 as marking an important development in the naval power of Wessex. The chronicler flattered his royal patron by boasting that Alfred's ships were not only larger, but swifter, steadier and rode higher in the water than either Danish or Frisian ships. It is probable that, under the classical tutelage of Asser, Alfred utilised the design of Greek and Roman warships, with high sides, designed for fighting rather than for navigation.          Alfred had seapower in mind—if he could intercept raiding fleets before they landed, he could spare his kingdom from ravaging. Alfred's ships may have been superior in conception. In practice they proved to be too large to manoeuvre well in the close waters of estuaries and rivers, the only places in which a naval battle could occur.          The warships of the time were not designed to be ship killers but troop carriers. It has been suggested that, like sea battles in late Viking age Scandinavia, these battles may have entailed a ship coming alongside an enemy vessel, at which point the crew would lash the two ships together before boarding the enemy craft. The result was effectively a land battle involving hand-to-hand fighting on board the two lashed vessels.          In the one recorded naval engagement in the year 896, Alfred's new fleet of nine ships intercepted six Viking ships in the mouth of an unidentified river along the south of England. The Danes had beached half their ships, and gone inland, either to rest their rowers or to forage for food. Alfred's ships immediately moved to block their escape to the sea. The three Viking ships afloat attempted to break through the English lines. Only one made it; Alfred's ships intercepted the other two.          Lashing the Viking boats to their own, the English crew boarded the enemy's vessels and proceeded to kill everyone on board. The one ship that escaped managed to do so only because all of Alfred's heavy ships became grounded when the tide went out. What ensued was a land battle between the crews of the grounded ships. The Danes, heavily outnumbered, would have been wiped out if the tide had not risen. When that occurred, the Danes rushed back to their boats, which being lighter, with shallower drafts, were freed before Alfred's ships. Helplessly, the English watched as the Vikings rowed past them. The pirates had suffered so many casualties (120 Danes dead against 62 Frisians and English), that they had difficulties putting out to sea. All were too damaged to row around Sussex and two were driven against the Sussex coast (possibly at Selsey Bill). The shipwrecked sailors were brought before Alfred at Winchester and were hanged.          In the late 880s or early 890s, Alfred issued a long ""domboc"" or law code, consisting of his ""own"" laws followed by a code issued by his late seventh-century predecessor King Ine of Wessex. Together these laws are arranged into 120 chapters. In his introduction, Alfred explains that he gathered together the laws he found in many ""synod-books"" and ""ordered to be written many of the ones that our forefathers observed—those that pleased me; and many of the ones that did not please me, I rejected with the advice of my councillors, and commanded them to be observed in a different way"".          Alfred singled out in particular the laws that he ""found in the days of Ine, my kinsman, or Offa, king of the Mercians, or King Æthelberht of Kent, who first among the English people received baptism."" He appended rather than integrated the laws of Ine into his code, and although he included, as had Æthelbert, a scale of payments in compensation for injuries to various body parts, the two injury tariffs are not aligned. Offa is not known to have issued a law code, leading historian Patrick Wormald to speculate that Alfred had in mind the legatine capitulary of 786 that was presented to Offa by two papal legates.          About a fifth of the law code is taken up by Alfred's introduction, which includes translations into English of the Decalogue, a few chapters from the Book of Exodus, and the ""Apostolic Letter"" from Acts of the Apostles (15:23–29). The Introduction may best be understood as Alfred's meditation upon the meaning of Christian law. It traces the continuity between God's gift of Law to Moses to Alfred's own issuance of law to the West Saxon people. By doing so, it links the holy past to the historical present and represents Alfred's law-giving as a type of divine legislation.          Similarly, Alfred divided his code into 120 chapters because 120 was the age at which Moses died and, in the number-symbolism of early medieval biblical exegetes, 120 stood for law. The link between the Mosaic Law and Alfred's code is the ""Apostolic Letter,"" which explained that Christ ""had come not to shatter or annul the commandments but to fulfill them; and he taught mercy and meekness"" (Intro, 49.1). The mercy that Christ infused into Mosaic Law underlies the injury tariffs that figure so prominently in barbarian law codes, since Christian synods ""established, through that mercy which Christ taught, that for almost every misdeed at the first offence secular lords might with their permission receive without sin the monetary compensation, which they then fixed"".          The only crime that could not be compensated with a payment of money is treachery to a lord, ""since Almighty God adjudged none for those who despised Him, nor did Christ, the Son of God, adjudge any for the one who betrayed Him to death; and He commanded everyone to love his lord as Himself"". Alfred's transformation of Christ's commandment from ""Love your neighbour as yourself"" (Matt. 22:39–40) to love your secular lord as you would love the Lord Christ himself underscores the importance that Alfred placed upon lordship, which he understood as a sacred bond instituted by God for the governance of man.          When one turns from the ""domboc""'s introduction to the laws themselves, it is difficult to uncover any logical arrangement. The impression one receives is of a hodgepodge of miscellaneous laws. The law code, as it has been preserved, is singularly unsuitable for use in lawsuits. In fact, several of Alfred's laws contradict the laws of Ine that form an integral part of the code. Patrick Wormald's explanation is that Alfred's law code should be understood not as a legal manual, but as an ideological manifesto of kingship, ""designed more for symbolic impact than for practical direction"". In practical terms, the most important law in the code may well be the very first: ""We enjoin, what is most necessary, that each man keep carefully his oath and his pledge,"" which expresses a fundamental tenet of Anglo-Saxon law.          Alfred devoted considerable attention and thought to judicial matters. Asser underscores his concern for judicial fairness. Alfred, according to Asser, insisted upon reviewing contested judgments made by his ealdormen and reeves, and ""would carefully look into nearly all the judgements which were passed [issued] in his absence anywhere in the realm, to see whether they were just or unjust"". A charter from the reign of his son Edward the Elder depicts Alfred as hearing one such appeal in his chamber, while washing his hands.          Asser represents Alfred as a Solomonic judge, painstaking in his own judicial investigations and critical of royal officials who rendered unjust or unwise judgments. Although Asser never mentions Alfred's law code, he does say that Alfred insisted that his judges be literate so that they could apply themselves ""to the pursuit of wisdom."" The failure to comply with this royal order was to be punished by loss of office.          The ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"", commissioned at the time of Alfred, was probably written to promote unification (of England), whereas Asser's ""The Life of King Alfred"" promoted Alfred's achievements and personal qualities. It was possible that the document was designed this way, so that it could be disseminated in Wales, as Alfred had recently acquired overlordship of that country.          Asser speaks grandiosely of Alfred's relations with foreign powers, but little definite information is available. His interest in foreign countries is shown by the insertions which he made in his translation of Orosius. He corresponded with Elias III, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, and embassies to Rome conveying the English alms to the Pope were fairly frequent. Around 890, Wulfstan of Hedeby undertook a journey from Hedeby on Jutland along the Baltic Sea to the Prussian trading town of Truso. Alfred personally collected details of this trip.          Alfred's relations with the Celtic princes in the western half of Britain are clearer. Comparatively early in his reign, according to Asser, the southern Welsh princes, owing to the pressure on them from North Wales and Mercia, commended themselves to Alfred. Later in his reign the North Welsh followed their example, and the latter cooperated with the English in the campaign of 893 (or 894). That Alfred sent alms to Irish and Continental monasteries may be taken on Asser's authority. The visit of the three pilgrim ""Scots"" (i.e. Irish) to Alfred in 891 is undoubtedly authentic. The story that he himself in his childhood was sent to Ireland to be healed by Saint Modwenna, though mythical, may show Alfred's interest in that island.          In the 880s, at the same time that he was ""cajoling and threatening"" his nobles to build and man the burhs, Alfred, perhaps inspired by the example of Charlemagne almost a century before, undertook an equally ambitious effort to revive learning. It entailed the recruitment of clerical scholars from Mercia, Wales and abroad to enhance the tenor of the court and of the episcopacy; the establishment of a court school to educate his own children, the sons of his nobles, and intellectually promising boys of lesser birth; an attempt to require literacy in those who held offices of authority; a series of translations into the vernacular of Latin works the king deemed ""most necessary for all men to know""; the compilation of a chronicle detailing the rise of Alfred's kingdom and house, with a genealogy that stretched back to Adam, thus giving the West Saxon kings a biblical ancestry.          Very little is known of the church under Alfred. The Danish attacks had been particularly damaging to the monasteries, and though Alfred founded monasteries at Athelney and Shaftesbury, these were the first new monastic houses in Wessex since the beginning of the eighth century. According to Asser, Alfred enticed foreign monks to England for his monastery at Athelney as there was little interest for the locals to take up the monastic life.          Alfred undertook no systematic reform of ecclesiastical institutions or religious practices in Wessex. For him the key to the kingdom's spiritual revival was to appoint pious, learned, and trustworthy bishops and abbots. As king he saw himself as responsible for both the temporal and spiritual welfare of his subjects. Secular and spiritual authority were not distinct categories for Alfred.          He was equally comfortable distributing his translation of Gregory the Great's ""Pastoral Care"" to his bishops so that they might better train and supervise priests, and using those same bishops as royal officials and judges. Nor did his piety prevent him from expropriating strategically sited church lands, especially estates along the border with the Danelaw, and transferring them to royal thegns and officials who could better defend them against Viking attacks.          The Danish raids had a devastating effect on learning in England. Alfred lamented in the preface to his translation of Gregory's ""Pastoral Care"" that ""learning had declined so thoroughly in England that there were very few men on this side of the Humber who could understand their divine services in English, or even translate a single letter from Latin into English: and I suppose that there were not many beyond the Humber either"". Alfred undoubtedly exaggerated for dramatic effect the abysmal state of learning in England during his youth. That Latin learning had not been obliterated is evidenced by the presence in his court of learned Mercian and West Saxon clerics such as Plegmund, Wæferth, and Wulfsige.          Manuscript production in England dropped off precipitously around the 860s when the Viking invasions began in earnest, not to be revived until the end of the century. Numerous Anglo-Saxon manuscripts burnt up along with the churches that housed them. And a solemn diploma from Christ Church, Canterbury dated 873 is so poorly constructed and written that historian Nicholas Brooks posited a scribe who was either so blind he could not read what he wrote or who knew little or no Latin. ""It is clear"", Brooks concludes, ""that the metropolitan church [of Canterbury] must have been quite unable to provide any effective training in the scriptures or in Christian worship"".          Following the example of Charlemagne, Alfred established a court school for the education of his own children, those of the nobility, and ""a good many of lesser birth"". There they studied books in both English and Latin and ""devoted themselves to writing, to such an extent ... they were seen to be devoted and intelligent students of the liberal arts"". He recruited scholars from the Continent and from Britain to aid in the revival of Christian learning in Wessex and to provide the king personal instruction. Grimbald and John the Saxon came from Francia; Plegmund (whom Alfred appointed archbishop of Canterbury in 890), Bishop Werferth of Worcester, Æthelstan, and the royal chaplains Werwulf, from Mercia; and Asser, from St David's in southwestern Wales.          Alfred's educational ambitions seem to have extended beyond the establishment of a court school. Believing that without Christian wisdom there can be neither prosperity nor success in war, Alfred aimed ""to set to learning (as long as they are not useful for some other employment) all the free-born young men now in England who have the means to apply themselves to it"". Conscious of the decay of Latin literacy in his realm, Alfred proposed that primary education be taught in English, with those wishing to advance to holy orders to continue their studies in Latin.           A problem, however, was that there were few ""books of wisdom"" written in English. Alfred sought to remedy this through an ambitious court-centred programme of translating into English the books he deemed ""most necessary for all men to know."" It is unknown when Alfred launched this programme, but it may have been during the 880s when Wessex was enjoying a respite from Viking attacks.          Apart from the lost ""Handboc"" or ""Encheiridion,"" which seems to have been a commonplace book kept by the king, the earliest work to be translated was the ""Dialogues"" of Gregory the Great, a book greatly popular in the Middle Ages. The translation was undertaken at Alfred's command by Werferth, Bishop of Worcester, with the king merely furnishing a preface. Remarkably, Alfred, undoubtedly with the advice and aid of his court scholars, translated four works himself: Gregory the Great's ""Pastoral Care"", Boethius's ""Consolation of Philosophy"", St. Augustine's ""Soliloquies"", and the first fifty psalms of the Psalter.          One might add to this list Alfred's translation, in his law code, of excerpts from the Vulgate Book of Exodus. The Old English versions of Orosius's ""Histories against the Pagans"" and Bede's ""Ecclesiastical History of the English People"" are no longer accepted by scholars as Alfred's own translations because of lexical and stylistic differences. Nonetheless, the consensus remains that they were part of the Alfredian programme of translation. Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge suggest this also for Bald's ""Leechbook"" and the anonymous ""Old English Martyrology"".          Alfred's first translation was of Pope Gregory the Great's ""Pastoral Care,"" which he prefaced with an introduction explaining why he thought it necessary to translate works such as this one from Latin into English. Although he described his method as translating ""sometimes word for word, sometimes sense for sense,"" Alfred's translation actually keeps very close to his original, although through his choice of language he blurred throughout the distinction between spiritual and secular authority. Alfred meant his translation to be used and circulated it to all his bishops. Interest in Alfred's translation of ""Pastoral Care"" was so enduring that copies were still being made in the 11th century.          Boethius' ""Consolation of Philosophy"" was the most popular philosophical handbook of the Middle Ages. Unlike his translation of the ""Pastoral Care"", Alfred here deals very freely with his original and though the late Dr. G. Schepss showed that many of the additions to the text are to be traced not to Alfred himself, but to the glosses and commentaries which he used, still there is much in the work which is solely Alfred's and highly characteristic of his style. It is in the Boethius that the oft-quoted sentence occurs: ""To speak briefly: I desired to live worthily as long as I lived, and after my life to leave to them that should come after, my memory in good works"". The book has come down to us in two manuscripts only. In one of these the writing is prose, in the other a combination of prose and alliterating verse.          The latter manuscript was severely damaged in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the authorship of the verse has been much disputed; but likely it also is by Alfred. In fact, he writes in the prelude that he first created a prose work and then used it as the basis for his poem ""Metres of Boethius"". He spent a great deal of time working on these books, which he tells us he gradually wrote through the many stressful times of his reign to refresh his mind. Of the authenticity of the work as a whole, there seems to be little doubt.          The last of Alfred's works is one to which he gave the name ""Blostman"", i.e., ""Blooms"" or Anthology. The first half is based mainly on the ""Soliloquies"" of St Augustine of Hippo, the remainder is drawn from various sources, and contains much that is Alfred's own and highly characteristic of him. The last words of it may be quoted; they form a fitting epitaph for the noblest of English kings. ""Therefore, he seems to me a very foolish man, and truly wretched, who will not increase his understanding while he is in the world, and ever wish and long to reach that endless life where all shall be made clear"". Alfred appears as a character in the twelfth- or thirteenth-century poem ""The Owl and the Nightingale,"" where his wisdom and skill with proverbs is praised. ""The Proverbs of Alfred"", a thirteenth-century work, contains sayings that are not likely to have originated with Alfred but attest to his posthumous medieval reputation for wisdom).          The Alfred jewel, discovered in Somerset in 1693, has long been associated with King Alfred because of its Old English inscription ""AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN"" (""Alfred ordered me to be made""). The jewel is about long, made of filigreed gold, enclosing a highly polished piece of quartz crystal beneath which is set a cloisonné enamel plaque, with an enamelled image of a man holding floriate sceptres, perhaps personifying Sight or the Wisdom of God.          It was at one time attached to a thin rod or stick based on the hollow socket at its base. The jewel certainly dates from Alfred's reign. Although its function is unknown, it has been often suggested that the jewel was one of the ""æstels""—pointers for reading—that Alfred ordered sent to every bishopric accompanying a copy of his translation of the ""Pastoral Care"". Each ""æstel"" was worth the princely sum of 50 mancuses, which fits in well with the quality workmanship and expensive materials of the Alfred jewel"".          Historian Richard Abels sees Alfred's educational and military reforms as complementary. Restoring religion and learning in Wessex, Abels contends, was to Alfred's mind as essential to the defence of his realm as the building of the burhs. As Alfred observed in the preface to his English translation of Gregory the Great's ""Pastoral Care"", kings who fail to obey their divine duty to promote learning can expect earthly punishments to befall their people. The pursuit of wisdom, he assured his readers of the Boethius, was the surest path to power: ""Study Wisdom, then, and, when you have learned it, condemn it not, for I tell you that by its means you may without fail attain to power, yea, even though not desiring it"".          The portrayal of the West-Saxon resistance to the Vikings by Asser and the chronicler as a Christian holy war was more than mere rhetoric or 'propaganda'. It reflected Alfred's own belief in a doctrine of divine rewards and punishments rooted in a vision of a hierarchical Christian world order in which God is the Lord to whom kings owe obedience and through whom they derive their authority over their followers. The need to persuade his nobles to undertake work for the 'common good' led Alfred and his court scholars to strengthen and deepen the conception of Christian kingship that he had inherited by building upon the legacy of earlier kings such as Offa as well as clerical writers such as Bede, Alcuin and the other luminaries of the Carolingian renaissance. This was not a cynical use of religion to manipulate his subjects into obedience, but an intrinsic element in Alfred's worldview. He believed, as did other kings in ninth-century England and Francia, that God had entrusted him with the spiritual as well as physical welfare of his people. If the Christian faith fell into ruin in his kingdom, if the clergy were too ignorant to understand the Latin words they butchered in their offices and liturgies, if the ancient monasteries and collegiate churches lay deserted out of indifference, he was answerable before God, as Josiah had been. Alfred's ultimate responsibility was the pastoral care of his people.          Asser wrote of Alfred in his ""Life of King Alfred"":          It is also written by Asser that Alfred did not learn to read until he was twelve years old or later, which is described as ""shameful negligence"" of his parents and tutors. It is true, however, that Alfred was an excellent listener and had an incredible memory, and he retained poetry and psalms very well. A story is told by Asser about how his mother held up a book of Saxon poetry to him and his brothers, and said; ""I shall give this book to whichever one of you can learn it the fastest."" After excitedly asking, ""Will you really give this book to the one of us who can understand it the soonest and recite it to you?"" Alfred then took it to his teacher, learned it, and recited it back to his mother.          Alfred is also noted as carrying around a small book, probably a medieval version of a small pocket notebook, which contained psalms and many prayers that he often collected. Asser writes: ""[these] he collected in a single book, as I have seen for myself; amid all the affairs of the present life he took it around with him everywhere for the sake of prayer, and was inseparable from it"".          An excellent hunter in every branch of the sport, Alfred is remembered as an enthusiastic huntsman against whom nobody’s skills could compare.          Although he was the youngest of his brothers, he was probably the most open-minded. Despite eventually becoming one of the greatest warriors and forgers of peace in the kingdom, he was an early advocate for education. His desire for learning could have come from his early love of English poetry and inability to read or physically record them until later in life. Asser writes that ""[Alfred] could not satisfy his craving for what he desired the most, namely the liberal arts; for, as he used to say, there were no good scholars in the entire kingdom of the West Saxons at that time"".          In 868, Alfred married Ealhswith, daughter of a Mercian nobleman, Æthelred Mucil, Ealdorman of the Gaini. The Gaini were probably one of the tribal groups of the Mercians. Ealhswith's mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal family.          They had five or six children together, including Edward the Elder, who succeeded his father as king, Æthelflæd, who became Lady (ruler) of the Mercians in her own right, and Ælfthryth who married Baldwin II the Count of Flanders. His mother was Osburga daughter of Oslac of the Isle of Wight, Chief Butler of England. Asser, in his ""Vita Ælfredi"" asserts that this shows his lineage from the Jutes of the Isle of Wight. This is unlikely as Bede tells us that they were all slaughtered by the Saxons under Cædwalla. In 2008 the skeleton of Queen Eadgyth, granddaughter of Alfred the Great was found in Magdeburg Cathedral in Germany. It was confirmed in 2010 that these remains belong to her — one of the earliest members of the English royal family.          Osferth was described as a relative in King Alfred's will and he attested charters in a high position until 934. A charter of King Edward's reign described him as the king's brother, ""mistakenly"" according to Keynes and Lapidge, but in the view of Janet Nelson, he probably was an illegitimate son of King Alfred.          Alfred died on 26 October 899. How he died is unknown, although he suffered throughout his life with a painful and unpleasant illness. His biographer Asser gave a detailed description of Alfred's symptoms and this has allowed modern doctors to provide a possible diagnosis. It is thought that he had either Crohn's disease or haemorrhoidal disease. His grandson King Eadred seems to have suffered from a similar illness.          Alfred was originally buried temporarily in the Old Minster in Winchester; then, four years after his death, he was moved to the New Minster (perhaps built especially to receive his body). When the New Minster moved to Hyde, a little north of the city, in 1110, the monks were transferred to Hyde Abbey, along with Alfred's body and those of his wife and children, which were presumably interred before the high altar. Soon after the dissolution of the abbey in 1539, during the reign of Henry VIII, the church was demolished, leaving the graves intact.          The royal graves and many others were probably rediscovered by chance in 1788 when a prison was being constructed by convicts on the site. Prisoners dug across the width of the altar area in order to dispose of rubble left at the dissolution. Coffins were stripped of lead, and bones were scattered and lost. The prison was demolished between 1846 and 1850. Further excavations in 1866 and 1897 were inconclusive. In 1866, amateur antiquarian John Mellor claimed to have recovered a number of bones from the site which he said were those of Alfred. These later came into the possession of the vicar of nearby St Bartholomew's Church, who reburied them in an unmarked grave in the church graveyard.          Excavations conducted by the Winchester Museums Service of the Hyde Abbey site in 1999 located a second pit dug in front of where the high altar would have been located, which was identified as probably dating to Mellor's 1886 excavation. The 1999 archeological excavation uncovered the foundations of the abbey buildings and some bones. Bones suggested at the time to be those of Alfred proved instead to belong to an elderly woman.          In March 2013, the Diocese of Winchester exhumed the bones from the unmarked grave at St Bartholomew's and placed them in secure storage. The Diocese made no claim they were the bones of Alfred, but intended to secure them for later analysis, and from the attentions of people whose interest may have been sparked by the recent identification of the remains of King Richard III. The bones were subsequently radiocarbon dated, but the results showed that they were from the 1300s and therefore unrelated to Alfred. However, it was announced in January 2014 that a fragment of pelvis unearthed in the 1999 excavation of the Hyde site, that had subsequently lain in a Winchester museum store room, had been radiocarbon dated to the correct period. It has been suggested that this bone may belong to either Alfred or his son Edward, but this remains unproven.          Alfred is venerated as a saint by some Christian traditions, however an attempt by Henry VI of England in 1441 to have him canonized by the pope was unsuccessful. The Anglican Communion venerates him as a Christian hero, with a feast day of 26 October, and he may often be found depicted in stained glass in Church of England parish churches.          Alfred commissioned Bishop Asser to write his biography, which inevitably emphasised Alfred's positive aspects. Later medieval historians, such as Geoffrey of Monmouth also reinforced Alfred's favourable image. By the time of the Reformation Alfred was seen as being a pious Christian ruler, who promoted the use of English rather than Latin, and so the translations that he commissioned were viewed as untainted by the later Roman Catholic influences of the Normans. Consequently, it was writers of the sixteenth century who gave Alfred his epithet as 'the Great', rather than any of Alfred's contemporaries. The epithet was retained by succeeding generations of Parliamentarians and empire-builders who saw Alfred's patriotism, success against barbarism, promotion of education and establishment of the rule of law as supporting their own ideals.          A number of educational establishments are named in Alfred's honour. These include:          The Royal Navy has named one ship and two shore establishments HMS King Alfred, and one of the first ships of the US Navy was named USS Alfred in his honour.          In 2002, Alfred the Great was ranked number 14 in the BBC's list of the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote.          A statue of Alfred the Great, situated in the Wantage market place, was sculpted by Count Gleichen, a relative of Queen Victoria's, and unveiled on 14 July 1877 by the Prince and Princess of Wales.          The statue was vandalised on New Year's Eve 2007, losing part of its right arm and axe. After the arm and axe were replaced the statue was again vandalised on Christmas Eve 2008, losing its axe.

676409,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=676409,Bane (comics),"Bane is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly as an adversary of the superhero Batman. The character's origin was in ""Batman: Vengeance of Bane"" #1 (January 1993), and was created by Chuck Dixon, Doug Moench, and Graham Nolan.          Known for his mix of brute strength and exceptional intelligence, the character is often credited as being the only villain to have ""Broken the Bat"". IGN's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Bane as #34. Bane was portrayed by Robert Swenson in the 1997 film ""Batman & Robin"" and by Tom Hardy in the 2012 film ""The Dark Knight Rises"".          Chuck Dixon, Graham Nolan, and Doug Moench created the character for the """" storyline, although it is unsure what elements were introduced by each of the two writers (Dixon and Moench). Dixon wrote the character's first appearance (""Vengeance of Bane""), with art by Graham Nolan. It is also unclear how much input was provided by Denny O'Neil (veteran writer of the ""Batman"" books, then Group Editor for the ""Batman"" family of books, and author of the novel adaptation of ""Knightfall""). O'Neil had previously created Bane's hellish birthplace of Santa Prisca in ""The Question"" and the drug Venom in the storyline of the same name (published in the pages of ""Legends of the Dark Knight"" #16-20, and later reprinted as a trade paperback). In the pages of ""Azrael"", O'Neil introduced Bane's perception of Venom as both an addiction and the weakness responsible for his earlier defeats.          Bane's origin story is established in the story ""Knightfall"". He was born in the fictional Caribbean Republic of Santa Prisca, in a prison called Peña Duro. His father, Edmund Dorrance (better known as King Snake), had been a revolutionary who had escaped Santa Prisca's court system. The corrupt government decreed that his young son would serve out the man's life sentence, and thus Bane's childhood and early adult life were spent in the immoral penitentiary environment.          Though he was imprisoned, his natural abilities allowed him to develop extraordinary skills within the prison's walls. He read as many books as he could get his hands on, spent most of his spare time body building in the prison's gym, developed his own form of meditation, and learned to fight in the merciless school of prison life. Because of the cultural and supposed geographical location of Santa Prisca, Bane knew how to speak English, Spanish, Portuguese and Latin. Despite his circumstances, he found teachers of various sorts during his incarceration, ranging from hardened convicts to an elderly Jesuit priest, under whose tutelage he apparently received a classical education. Bane murdered this priest upon his return to Santa Prisca years later. He committed his first murder at the age of eight, stabbing a criminal who wanted to use him to gain information about the prison. During his years in prison, Bane carried a teddy bear he called Osito (""Little bear"" in Spanish), whom he considered his only friend. It is revealed that Osito has a hole in his back to hold a knife that Bane used to defend himself.          Bane is tortured by a monstrous, terrifying bat creature that appears in his dreams, thus giving him chiroptophobia (fear of bats). He ultimately established himself as the ""king"" of Peña Duro prison and became known as Bane. The prison's controllers took note and eventually forced him to become a test subject for a mysterious drug known as Venom, which had killed all other subjects; the drug was administered by a doctor who bore a passing resemblance to another Batman foe, Hugo Strange. Later, in ""Vengeance of Bane II"" the very same doctor encountered Bane again in Gotham City and it is confirmed that it is not Hugo Strange, who, at that point in Batman continuity, was a crazed psychologist and not a surgeon. The Peña Duro prison Venom experiment nearly killed Bane at first, but he survived and found that the drug vastly increases his physical strength, although he needs to take it every 12 hours (via a system of tubes pumped directly into his brain) or he will suffer debilitating side-effects.          During the """" storyline, Bane escaped Peña Duro, along with several accomplices based on the Fabulous Five (his minions Trogg, Zombie and Bird, all of whom are named after 1960s rock bands — The Troggs, The Zombies and The Byrds — and were designed to mimic three of Doc Savage's assistants Monk, Ham, and Renny). His ambition turned to destroying Batman, about whom he had heard stories from an inmate. Gotham fascinated Bane because, like Peña Duro, fear rules Gotham - but it is the fear of the Batman. Bane was convinced that Batman was a personification of the demonic bat which had haunted his dreams since childhood. Therefore, Bane believed fate placed Batman on a collision course with him.          Aware that a direct assault on Batman would be foolish, Bane instead destroyed the walls of Arkham Asylum—allowing its deranged inmates (including the Joker, Two-Face, the Riddler, the Scarecrow, the Mad Hatter, the Ventriloquist, Firefly, Poison Ivy, Cornelius Stirk, Film Freak and Victor Zsasz) to escape into Gotham City. Consequently, Batman was forced to recapture the escapees, a mission that took him three months. Exhausted, Batman returned to his home in the Batcave then went up to Wayne Manor as Bruce Wayne, where he found Bane waiting for him (who had previously figured out his secret identity). Bane attacked Bruce, first in Wayne Manor but then the two tumbled down into the Batcave below, where Bane continued his assault on Bruce Wayne, toying with him throughout. Bane delivered the final blow by raising Bruce up and throwing him down upon his knee, breaking his back and he left him a paraplegic. Bane thus becomes the only man to have ""Broken the Bat"". This iconic moment is incorporated in ""The Dark Knight Rises"", Robot Chicken's ""DC Comics Special"" and alluded to numerous times in the DCAU cartoons.          While Bane established himself as the new ruler of Gotham's criminal underworld, Bruce Wayne passed the mantle of Batman to Jean-Paul Valley, also known as Azrael. As the ""new"" Batman, however, Jean-Paul grew increasingly violent and ruthless; he believed that the only way to defeat criminals is to go to their level. Valley also refused to recognize Tim Drake/Robin as his partner. Despite Bruce Wayne's strict orders that Valley avoid Bane, he disregarded those commands and boldly attempted to confront Bane in his home; with the villain then living in luxury high above Gotham in a penthouse suite. Valley had by then added a set of high-tech, heavy metal gauntlets to the Batsuit, and used them to shoot sharp projectiles at Bane. But Bane was able to get the upper hand in the fight after using Venom and taunting Valley, making him angry enough to rush him. Despite besting Valley, Bane sustained deep lacerations in the battle and lost a great deal of blood. Unable to go to a hospital, Bane increased his Venom intake to temporarily block the pain and buy himself time to defeat the new Batman. Humiliated, Valley returned to the Batcave where he built an advanced combat suit of metal, in place of the traditional Batsuit, with many chambers within the suit that fire razor-sharp weapons. Reduced to little more than a wounded animal fleeing for survival, Bane was no match against the ""new"" Batman and was overwhelmed by him. Bane was finally defeated when Valley severed the tubes that pump Venom into his bloodstream, causing severe withdrawal. Commissioner James Gordon, Harvey Bullock, and the Tim Drake Robin watched in horror as this new Batman tortured a defeated Bane, who begs Valley to kill him. Valley denied his innate urge to kill Bane, however, and left him to be arrested.          Bane became an Arkham Asylum inmate and plotted his escape and revenge on Batman and his allies. Jean-Paul Valley lost the mantle of the Bat whilst Bruce Wayne is fully recovered.          Further following the events of ""Knightfall"", Bane recovers from his Venom addiction while serving time in Blackgate Prison, as seen in ""Vengeance of Bane II: The Redemption"" (1995). He eventually escapes from prison and returns to Gotham, where he fights alongside Batman to take out a criminal ring that is distributing a Venom derivative to street-level thugs. Following a victory over the criminals (and the revelation that behind it is the same doctor that performed the surgery on Bane years earlier in Peña Dura), Bane proclaims that he is ""innocent"" of his past crimes and urges Batman to stop hunting him. He then leaves Gotham (without fighting Batman) to begin a search for his dead father.          Bane's search brings him back to Santa Prisca. In search of leads, Bane questions the Jesuit priest who had taught him while he was in Peña Dura. The priest explains that there were four men who could possibly have been his father: a Santa Priscan revolutionary, an American doctor, an English mercenary and a Swiss banker. While searching for the Swiss man in Rome, Bane encounters Talia al Ghul and the League of Assassins and eventually impresses Ra's al Ghul so much that he chooses Bane to marry Talia and become his heir (an ""honor"" he had previously bestowed on Batman).          Ra's al Ghul then launches a plague attack on Gotham in the ""Legacy"" storyline, with Bane at his side, who is posing as Ubu. Bruce Wayne, again costumed as Batman, gets his rematch with Bane in ""Detective Comics"" #701 and finally defeats him in single combat. The defeat causes Ra's to call off the engagement to Talia and disown Bane.          Following the ""Legacy"" storyline, Bane appears in a one-shot publication called ""Batman: Bane"" (1997) with the intent of destroying Gotham City using a nuclear reactor until the plan is stopped by Batman and his allies. He fights Azrael in the ""Angel and the Bane"" storyline. Bane then surfaces in the story arc ""No Man's Land"", serving as an enforcer for Lex Luthor during Luthor's attempts to take control of Gotham under the cover of helping it to rebuild, but Batman convinces Bane to leave after a brief confrontation between Bane and the Joker. Following the fallout with Ra's al Ghul, Bane later embarks on a campaign to destroy Lazarus Pits around the world, and in the process, encounters Black Canary.          According to the Jesuit priest, with whom Bane speaks, there is a possibility that Bane's biological father is an American doctor. In researching this issue, Bane comes to the conclusion that he and Batman share Dr. Thomas Wayne as their biological father, with Dr. Wayne allegedly becoming close to Bane's mother during his time in Santa Prisca. Bane alerts Batman to this possibility and during the time that the DNA tests are being performed, stays at Wayne Manor and fights alongside Batman on the streets of Gotham in the ""Tabula Rasa"" storyline. Ultimately, it is revealed that Dr. Wayne is not Bane's father, and Bane leaves Gotham peacefully (and with Batman's blessing and financial backing) to pursue leads in the snowy mountains of Kangchenjunga.          Bane eventually finds his father, who turns out to be the unscrupulous King Snake (validating the English mercenary hypothesis), and not El Jefe del País de Santa Prisca, in the ""Veritas Liberat"" storyline. Bane, with Batman looking on, helps foil King Snake's plans to unleash a powerful weapon upon the world. Bane saves Batman from being shot by King Snake, but is mortally wounded in the process. Batman then saves Bane by bathing him in a Lazarus Pit, and leaves him with a clean slate.          In ""Infinite Crisis"" #7, Bane fights alongside the villains during the Battle of Metropolis. During the battle, he breaks the back of the hero Judomaster, killing him. No reason was given for his actions in #7, though in ""Infinite Crisis""' collected edition, one of the many changes made to the original series was Bane saying ""I finally know who I am. I am 'Bane'. I 'break' people."" while breaking Judomaster's back.          Bane resurfaces in the ""One Year Later"" continuity of ""JSA Classified"" #17-18 searching for the Hourmen (Rex and Rick Tyler), asking them for help. To win their trust, he tells them how, prior to the Battle of Metropolis, he returned to his homeland to put an end to the drug lords' government and in the process discovered that a new, more addictive strain of Venom had been created. In his furious carelessness to wipe out the drug trade, he was captured, and re implanted with the cranial tubes, hooked to the new Venom, and now unable to shake off his addiction without dying from the withdrawal. Bane was forced to work as an enforcer for the drug cartel, unable to escape. Believing that Bane sought Rex Tyler's expertise in chemistry, Rick lets him approach his father, only to discover that the story is a ruse. Bane, who had never truly been addicted to Venom, had in fact wiped out the drug lords, and destroyed every research note on Venom. He discovered in the process both strains of Venom derived from Rex Tyler's early research on Miraclo. He discovers from the Tylers that no written notes exist of Rex' work, captures Rex, and steals Rick's equipment, planning to kill Rex and force Rick to take the last of the new Venom, living forever as an addict. Rick manipulates Bane into using Miraclo and demolishing the building as he and his father escape, burying the mercenary in the rubble of the very same Santa Priscan penitentiary where his story began.          Eventually, Bane resurfaces in Santa Prisca and leads the country to democratic elections. Upon discovering that the elections were rigged by Computron, he uses his influence to enforce martial law, plunging the country into a civil war. Computron offers information to Checkmate who ordered him to rig the elections in exchange for their help to escape the country. Fire and Judomaster's son, Thomas Jagger, are sent on the mission, with Jagger debating whether or not to seek revenge for his father's murder. He fights Bane in order to allow Fire to escape, defeating him easily, but chooses not to kill him.          At the end of the miniseries ""Suicide Squad: Raise the Flag"", Amanda Waller recruits Bane into the Squad. In ""Outsiders"" #50, he appears once more to be wearing the tubing system to apply Venom.          In ""Salvation Run"" #2, Bane was tricked by his fellow squad members, and sent to the prison planet. In ""Salvation Run"" #3, Bane remains with Lex Luthor's faction after the Joker's faction rebels against Luthor's leadership. He attacks Thunder and Lightning when they were attempting to feed Martian Manhunter.          ""Superman/Batman"" #53-#56 reveals Bane is trading his Venom supplies with drug lords around the globe. One of his shipments includes a trip to Gotham. Batman, who was temporarily endowed with Superman's powers, responded by attacking Bane at his home. Not only was the Dark Knight able to easily defeat the villain, the hero nearly killed him with his far superior strength. Bane survived his injuries due to the enhanced stamina from his Venom supplies.          Since September 2008, Bane has appeared as a regular character in the ongoing Secret Six series. In the first issue, Bane is depicted as a stoic devil's advocate for the group, offering alternative points of view for both Deadshot and Catman on the subject of love. He is later shown to have an almost father like concern for Scandal Savage's well-being. Although this is largely played for laughs in the early issues, the first arc's final issue displays the depth of Bane's affection. When the Six are attacked by an army of supervillains, a wounded (and seemingly dying) Bane's concern for Scandal results in temporarily breaking his vow to never take Venom again in order to save her. Bane is later shown to have recovered from his ordeal, appearing in Gotham City with Cat-Man and Ragdoll in an attempt to stem some of the chaos caused by the apparent death of Batman. During the team's several escapades, Bane reveals both a deep respect for his onetime adversary and a painful yearning to assume the mantle of Batman, telling a trio of rescued citizens to tell people that it was the Batman who saved them. Bane ultimately gives his blessing to Dick Grayson, praying that ""God help him."" Following a near-disastrous mission, Bane assumes leadership over the Six. His first act as leader is to remove Scandal from active duty, not wishing for her to be endangered. In the latest issue of ""Secret Six"", Bane's Secret Six and Scandal Savage's Secret Six finally square off against each other. Bane and Scandal engage in a one on one fight where he refuses to fight back until Scandal uses her Lamentation Blades to slash his throat. The card is ultimately used to resurrect Knockout.          Driven to near madness, Bane decides to lead the Secret Six to Gotham in an attempt to psychologically break Batman by killing several of his closest allies. The team kidnaps the Penguin, who Bane pumps for information about Batman's partners. In the final issue of the series, Bane ultimately decides on Red Robin, Azrael and Batgirl as his victims. Before the Six can make their move, Penguin betrays their location, resulting in a massive army of superheroes ranging from Green Lantern, Batman and the Superman family to the Justice League, Birds of Prey, and Booster Gold converging on Gotham. The Secret Six stage a desperate last stand, but are quickly defeated. With the fates of the other Secret Six members left ambiguous, Bane is last shown being driven away in a Gotham police van. The ending of the issue implies that he plans to escape.          In the company relaunch called The New 52, Bane is re-introduced in the DCU by Paul Jenkins, and David Finch's run on """" Volume 2. Here, he has a massive storage tank on his back and is still fighting his addiction to the Venom compound. As Bruce Wayne is unable to keep up with the various legal conspiracies involving Batman Incorporated, he decides to investigate a breakout in Arkham. There he finds criminals being fed a modified fear toxin that is mixed in with Venom which makes the criminals extremely strong and immune to fear. He finds it being given to criminals by a new foe named the White Rabbit, when Batman approaches her she quickly defeats him and injects him with the fear toxin which she then gives to the Flash. Bruce then finds Bane to be behind the new fear toxin and combats him, Bruce manages to burn the fear toxin out of his and the Flash's bodies by getting pushed to the limit. Bruce manages to defeat Bane and knock him off an edge, but is left confused by the White Rabbit. Bane is then washed away by the tide.          Bane later appears in ""Detective Comics (Vol. 2)"" #19, in the story ""War Council"". There, his look had been altered to include a vest and cargo pants, and he now has an army serving him. In the story, it's revealed in flashback that prior to his appearance in ""Batman: The Dark Knight"", Bane had intended to steal a nuclear device to threaten Gotham City, only to have a run-in with the Court of Owls, who prevented him from stealing the device and didn't want him to interfere with their plans. Later, after Batman defeats Bane, a mysterious figure confronts the villain and informs him that the Court of Owls had undermined his plans. Bane returns to Santa Prisca to lead his army against them.          During the ""Forever Evil"" storyline, Scarecrow learns that Bane may be the cause of the Blackgate uprising and will be their leader in the impending war, and that Talons were stored at Blackgate on ice. Bane, having escaped Peña Dura Prison in Santa Prisca, ships his Venom to Gotham City to be there for when he arrives. As he is traveling to Gotham, he orchestrates the release of Blackgate's prisoners during the Crime Syndicate's broadcast to the world. Later, on board his ship, he prepares his men for the impending war with Scarecrow, and with Gotham in the distant, claims it will be his. Bane enters Blackgate through the sewers to join the prisoners there. While there, he comes across where the Talons are stored hoping to make them in to his weapons. While the attack on Gotham City begins between Bane's men and the GCPD, Bane also approaches Professor Pyg, forcing him to join his cause, and spread word that everything in Gotham is now controlled by Bane. Bane arrives at Blackgate as Man-Bat and his fellow bats are attempting to transport the Talons to Mr. Freeze and is able to keep one from leaving. Bane retrieves Emperor Penguin for the Penguin as part of their agreement. When Bane brings Emperor Blackgate to the Penguin, the Penguin tells him that the Arkham fighters are not scared of Bane as he does not instill fear as Batman did. Realizing this, Bane constructs a batsuit for himself and heads to Wayne Tower to confront Killer Croc. Bane fights Killer Croc and is able to defeat him, setting his sights on retrieving the Talons. Bane wakes up the Talon William Cobb and takes him through Gotham where he fights members of Arkham Asylum. Bane begins recruiting Gotham citizens to his side, offering his base at Wayne Tower as a haven to the people to escape the rule of the Arkham inmates. He tells Cobb his plan to turn the city over to the Court, in exchange for use of Talons at his disposal to be powered by his Venom. The Talons attack Bane's men, and eventually set their target on Bane. With the help of Cobb, Bane is able to injure the Talons enough to activate their regenerative powers to remove the mind-control technology.          Bane is highly intelligent; in ""Bane of the Demon"", Ra's al Ghul says that Bane ""has a mind equal to the greatest he has known"" (although he dismisses Bane's intellect as the cunning of an animal rather than the cultured, trained intellect of Batman). His strength gives him more ways to go against Batman. Bane has shown to be capable of lifting 15 tons. In prison, he taught himself various scientific disciplines equal to the level of understanding of leading experts in those fields. He knows six active languages and at least two additional arcane and dead ones. Among these are Spanish, English, Persian, and Latin. The ""Bane of the Demon"" storyline reveals that he has an eidetic memory. Within one year, he is able to deduce Batman's secret identity.          He is also highly devious and a superb strategist and tactician. In prison, Bane also invented his own form of calisthenics, meditation, and a fighting style that he uses against other well-known martial arts fighters within the DC Universe. Bane creator Chuck Dixon's early tales portray Bane as a very calm, centered warrior akin to Bruce Lee; in as much that he draws strength through calm meditation, and the spiritual energy of the ""very rock of Peña Dura"". Dixon imbued Bane with an almost supernatural quality when he explained that Bane triumphed in all of his prison fights by employing these abilities, while his opponents had only rage and greed to propel them. Multiple scenes in ""Vengeance of Bane"" explore this aspect when it explains that Bane's mastery of meditation techniques ""made time and space playthings to him."" A subsequent scene that reinforces this ability comes when Bird first comes to Bane for help, because he heard from other inmates that Bane has ""magic... the kind that allows him to travel beyond the prison walls."" Usage of Venom enhances his physical abilities, including his strength and healing process, to superhuman levels.          Although Bane had sworn off using Venom in ""Vengeance of Bane II"" in 1995, and his character is actually written as having kept that promise to himself, it is still not uncommon for artists to draw Bane as still wearing the tube leading from his old wrist device to the back of his head, as well as almost all media adaptations of the character show him actively using the Venom compound. Writer Gail Simone explained these lapses in the continuity of Bane's appearance in an issue of ""Secret Six"", in which Deadshot remarked that Bane merely kept his old Venom equipment with him out of habit, even though Bane states that he would sooner die than use it again.          In the ""Amalgam universe"", Bane was combined with Marvel Comics' Nuke as HYDRA's Bane Simpson, Another version of Bane was merged with Punisher called the ""Banisher"" appeared. He's described as a ""gun-toting, drugged up anti-hero who broke Bruce Wayne's back.""          In the ""Kingdom Come"" reality, an aged Bruce Wayne mentions to Superman that Bane and Two-Face broke into Wayne Manor and destroyed it, after Batman's identity was exposed, leaving only the Batcave intact.          Bane appeared in numerous ""Elseworlds"" including """" as a low-level criminal, a dead Bane appears in a brief cameo in ""JLA: Riddle of the Beast"", killed by Green Arrow.          Bane appears in ""Smallville"" comic ""Smallville Season Eleven"".          In ""Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"", Bane was mutated into a humanoid mutant elephant.          Bane makes his first appearance in Year Five of the ""Injustice: Gods Among Us"" comic series. He decides allying himself with Superman's Regime will give him a position of power, so he aides the Man of Steel and Wonder Woman in subduing Doomsday. While initially suspicious of Bane's motivations, Superman is convinced Bane could be a valuable asset to the Regime and agrees. However, this decision does not bode well with the rest of the Regime, who openly resent the idea of working alongside their former enemies.","['Characters created by Chuck Dixon', 'Characters created by Doug Moench', 'Characters created by Graham Nolan', 'Comics characters introduced in 1993', 'DC Comics characters with accelerated healing', 'DC Comics characters with superhuman strength', 'DC Comics martial artists', 'Fictional assassins', 'Fictional bounty hunters', 'Fictional chemists', 'Fictional drug addicts', 'Fictional drug dealers', 'Fictional henchmen', 'Fictional Hispanic and Latino-American people', 'Fictional linguists', 'Fictional mercenaries', 'Fictional mixed martial artists', 'Superhero film characters', 'Video game bosses']"

7181598,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7181598,J. Arch Getty,"John Archibald Getty, III (born November 30, 1950) is an American revisionist historian and professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. He is noted for his research on Russian and Soviet history, especially the period under Joseph Stalin and the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.          Getty was born in Louisiana but grew up in Oklahoma. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1972 and his Ph.D. from Boston College in 1979. Getty was a professor at the University of California, Riverside before moving to UCLA.          Getty established himself as a forerunner among revisionist historians of the Soviet Union with his first book, ""Origin of the Great Purges: The Soviet Communist Party Reconsidered, 1933-1938"" (Cambridge 1985). Most recently, Getty has published a biography of N.I. Yezhov (2008). He is a controversial figure in the field of Soviet studies, as he was one of the first to put forth the thesis that the Great Purge was planned and commanded not by Stalin, but by Yezhov and other Stalin's subordinates. According to Robert Conquest, ""Getty belongs to a gaggle of ‘revisionists’ who have achieved, like David Irving in another sphere, a certain notoriety. They are for some reason concerned to deny that much of a terror took place in the USSR in the Thirties, a stance only achievable by rejecting ... the vast corpus of evidence to the contrary.          In particular, Arch Getty tried to justify that Stalin was not culpable for Kirov's assassination, calling it ""complicated and at least secondhand."" Getty echoed Khrushchev's observation of NKVD complicity in the murder. However, he considered the confession by NKVD head, Genrikh Yagoda that he arranged the murder of Kirov as a proof of Stalin's innocence. Getty argued that it would have been ""very dangerous to allow [Yagoda] to appear later before the microphones of the world press"" if he had knowledge of Stalin's complicity because he ""knew that he would be shot anyway"" and ""it would have been easy for him to let slip that Stalin had put him up to it.""          Jonathan Haslam remarks on the paradox that Getty's work is rehabilitating Stalin's reputation just when Soviet historians were exposing the details of Stalin's crimes against the Soviet people.","['1950 births', 'Living people', 'American biographers', 'Male biographers', 'American historians', 'Boston College alumni', 'Guggenheim Fellows', 'Historians of communism', 'Historians of Russia', 'Writers from Louisiana', 'University of California, Los Angeles faculty', 'University of Pennsylvania alumni', 'Stalinism-era scholars and writers', 'Historical revisionism']"
