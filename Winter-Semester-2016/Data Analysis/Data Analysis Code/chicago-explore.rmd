## Chicago-Crime Dataset

The dataset contains information about crimes reported to the policy in Chicago. This covers data about
the location, date, time and type of the crime in various formats.
```{r Chicago-Crimes Sample}
library(ggplot2)
summary(chicago_crimes_sample)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r Chicago-Crimes Sample}
library(ggplot2)
# When does crimes occur
ggplot(data=chicago_crimes_sample) + geom_histogram(binwidth=50, aes(x=chicago_crimes_sample$Year)) + ggtitle("Which year has more cimes?")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
