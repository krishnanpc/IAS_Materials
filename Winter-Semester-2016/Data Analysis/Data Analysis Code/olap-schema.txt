Discuss which data should be part of the fact table and which should be an attribute of the dimensions.
Consider carefully which attribute should be a fact

Fact table: WikiLog
metric of the fact: TimeSpent
This is the only measurement identified in the given context.
And it can be added to all dimensions.

dimension attributes:
	- Time 
	- Visitor
	- Browser
	- User
	
All dimension attributes are foreign keys in the FACT.
And they all constitute the primary key of the fact.

The dimensions are defined below.
They all have surrogate keys as primary keys.
This decision was based on the reference:
