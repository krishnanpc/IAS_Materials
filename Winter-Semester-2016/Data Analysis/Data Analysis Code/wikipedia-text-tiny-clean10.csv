Lambda calculus"; lambda calculus found early successes in the area of [[computability theory]], such as a negative answer to [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]'s [[Entscheidungsproblem]]. Lambda calculus is a conceptually simple [[Turing completeness|universal model of computation]] (Turing showed in 1937<ref>{{cite journal |first=A. M. |last=Turing |title=Computability and λ-Definability |jstor=2268280 |journal=The Journal of Symbolic Logic |volume=2 |issue=4 |date=December 1937 |pages=153–163 |doi=10.2307/2268280}}</ref>that [[Turing machine]]s equated{{what|reason=equalled?|date=May 2015}} the lambda calculus in expressiveness). The name derives from the Greek letter lambda (λ) used to denote [[Free variables and bound variables|binding]] a variable in a function. The letter itself is arbitrary and has no special meaning. Lambda calculus is taught and used in computer science because of its usefulness in showcasing functional thinking and iterative reduction.<ref>{{citation|title=Concepts in Programming Languages|first=John C.|last=Mitchell|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=9780521780988|page=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Uh8XGfJbEIC&pg=PA57}}.</ref>Because of the importance of the notion of variable binding and substitution, there is not just one system of lambda calculus, and in particular there are ''typed'' and ''untyped'' variants. Historically, the most important system was the untyped lambda calculus, in which function application has no restrictions (so the notion of the [[domain of a function]] is not built into the system). In the [[Church–Turing thesis|Church&ndash.Turing Thesis]], the untyped lambda calculus is claimed to be capable of computing all [[effective method|effectively calculable]] functions. The typed lambda calculus is a variety that restricts function application, so that functions can only be applied if they are capable of accepting the given input's""type""of data.Today, the lambda calculus has applications in many different areas in [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]],<ref>Coquand, Thierry, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/type-theory/""Type Theory""], ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''  (Summer 2013 Edition), Edward N.

It is still used in the area of computability theory, although Turing machines are also an important model for computation. Lambda calculus has played an important role in the development of the [[Programming language theory|theory of programming languages]]. Counterparts to lambda calculus in computer science are [[functional programming language]]s, which essentially implement the lambda calculus (augmented with some [[Constant (programming)|constants]] and [[datatype]]s). Beyond programming languages, the lambda calculus also has many applications in [[proof theory]]. A major example of this is the [[Curry&ndash.Howard correspondence]], which gives a correspondence between different systems of typed lambda calculus and systems of [[formal logic]].==Lambda calculus in history of mathematics==The lambda calculus was introduced by mathematician [[Alonzo Church]] in the 1930s as part of an investigation into the [[foundations of mathematics]].<ref>A. Church,""A set of postulates for the foundation of logic"", ''Annals of Mathematics'', Series 2, 33:346–366 (1932).</ref><ref>For a full history, see Cardone and Hindley's""History of Lambda-calculus and Combinatory Logic""(2006).</ref>The original system was shown to be [[Consistency|logically inconsistent]] in 1935 when [[Stephen Kleene]] and [[J. B. Rosser]] developed the [[Kleene&ndash.Rosser paradox]].Subsequently, in 1936 Church isolated and published just the portion relevant to computation, what is now called the untyped lambda calculus.<ref>A. Church,""An unsolvable problem of elementary number theory"", ''American Journal of Mathematics'', Volume 58, No. 2. (April 1936), pp. 345-363.</ref>In 1940, he also introduced a computationally weaker, but logically consistent system, known as the [[simply typed lambda calculus]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Church | first1 = A. | year = | title = A Formulation of the Simple Theory of Types | url = | journal = Journal of Symbolic Logic | volume = 5 | issue = | page = 1940 | doi=10.2307/2266170}}</ref>==Informal description=={{no footnotes|section|date=September 2013}}===Motivation===[[Computable function]]s are a fundamental concept within computer science and mathematics. The λ-calculus provides a simple [[Semantics#Computer science|semantics]] for computation, enabling properties of computation to be studied formally. The λ-calculus incorporates two simplifications that make this semantics simple.The first simplification is that the λ-calculus treats functions""anonymously"", without giving them explicit names. For example, the function:<math>\operatorname{sqsum}(x, y) = x \times x + y \times y</math>can be rewritten in ''anonymous form'' as:<math>(x, y) \mapsto x \times x + y \times y</math>(read as""the pair of<math>x</math>and<math>y</math>is [[Map (disambiguation)#Mathematics and programming|mapped]] to<math>x \times x + y \times y</math>""). Similarly,:<math>\operatorname{id}(x) = x</math>can be rewritten in anonymous form as<math>x \mapsto x</math>, where the input is simply mapped to itself.The second simplification is that the λ-calculus only uses functions of a single input. An ordinary function that requires two inputs, for instance the<math>\operatorname{sqsum}</math>function, can be reworked into an equivalent function that accepts a single input, and as output returns ''another'' function, that in turn accepts a single input. For example,:<math>(x, y) \mapsto x \times x + y \times y</math>can be reworked into:<math>x \mapsto (y \mapsto x \times x + y \times y)</math>This method, known as [[currying]], transforms a function that takes multiple arguments into a chain of functions each with a single argument.[[Function application]] of the<math>\operatorname{sqsum}</math>function to the arguments (5, 2), yields at once:<math>((x, y) \mapsto x \times x + y \times y)(5, 2)</math>:<math>= 5 \times 5 + 2 \times 2</math>:<math>= 29</math>,whereas evaluation of the curried version requires one more step:<math>((x \mapsto (y \mapsto x \times x + y \times y))(5))(2)</math>:<math>= (y \mapsto 5 \times 5 + y \times y)(2)</math>:<math>= 5 \times 5 + 2 \times 2</math>:<math>= 29</math>to arrive at the same result.===The lambda calculus===The lambda calculus consists of a language of '''lambda terms''', which is defined by a certain formal syntax, and a set of transformation rules, which allow manipulation of the lambda terms. These transformation rules can be viewed as an equational theory or as an [[operational definition]].As described above, all functions in the lambda calculus are anonymous functions, having no names. They only accept one input variable, with currying used to implement functions with several variables.====Lambda terms====The syntax of the lambda calculus defines some expressions as valid lambda calculus expression and some as invalid, just as some strings of characters are valid [[C (programming language)|C]] programs and some are not. A valid lambda calculus expression is called a""lambda term"".The following three rules give an [[inductive definition]] that can be applied to build all syntactically valid lambda terms:* a variable,<math>x</math>, is itself a valid lambda term* if<math>t</math>is a lambda term, and<math>x</math>is a variable, then<math>(\lambda x.t)</math>is a lambda term (called a '''lambda abstraction''').* if<math>t</math>and<math>s</math>are lambda terms, then<math>(ts)</math>is a lambda term (called an '''application''').Nothing else is a lambda term. Thus a lambda term is valid if and only if it can be obtained by repeated application of these three rules. However, some parentheses can be omitted according to certain rules. For example, the outermost parentheses are usually not written. ''See'' [[#Notation]], below.A '''lambda abstraction'''<math>\lambda x.t</math>is a definition of an anonymous function that is capable of taking a single input<math>x</math>and substituting it into the expression<math>t</math>.It thus defines an anonymous function that takes x and returns t. For example<math>\lambda x.x^2+2</math>is a lambda abstraction for the function<math>f(x) = x^2 + 2</math>using the term<math>x^2+2</math>for<math>t</math>. The definition of a function with a lambda abstraction merely""sets up""the function but does not invoke it.  The abstraction [[Free variables and bound variables|binds]] the variable<math>x</math>in the term<math>t</math>.An '''application'''<math>ts</math>represents the application of a function<math>t</math>to an input<math>s</math>, that is, it represents the act of calling function<math>t</math>on input<math>s</math>to produce<math>t(s)</math>.There is no concept in lambda calculus of variable declaration. In a definition such as<math>\lambda x.x+y</math>(i.e.<math>f(x) = x + y</math>), the lambda calculus treats<math>y</math>as a variable that is not yet defined. The lambda abstraction<math>\lambda x.x+y</math>is syntactically valid, and represents a function that adds its input to the yet-unknown<math>y</math>.Bracketing may be used and may be needed to disambiguate terms. For example,<math>\lambda x.((\lambda x.x)x)</math>and<math>(\lambda x.(\lambda x.x)) x</math>denote different terms (although coincidentally reduce to the same value.)==== Functions that operate on functions ====In lambda calculus, functions are taken to be '[[First-class object|first class values]]', so functions may be used as the inputs, or be returned as outputs from other functions.For example,<math>\lambda x.x</math>represents the identity function,<math>x \rightarrow x</math>, and<math>(\lambda x.x)y</math>represents the identity function applied to<math>y</math>. Further,<math>(\lambda x.y)</math>represents the '''constant function'''<math>x \rightarrow y</math>, the function that always returns<math>y</math>, no matter the input. In lambda calculus, function application is regarded as [[Operator associativity|left-associative]], so that<math>stx</math>means<math>(st)x</math>.There are several notions of""equivalence""and""reduction""that allow lambda terms to be""reduced""to""equivalent""lambda terms.====Alpha equivalence====A basic form of equivalence, definable on lambda terms, is alpha equivalence. It captures the intuition that the particular choice of a bound variable, in a lambda abstraction, does not (usually) matter.For instance,<math>\lambda x.x</math>and<math>\lambda y.y</math>are alpha-equivalent lambda terms, and they both represent the same function (the identity function).The terms<math>x</math>and<math>y</math>are not alpha-equivalent, because they are not bound in a lambda abstraction.In many presentations, it is usual to identify alpha-equivalent lambda terms.The following definitions are necessary in order to be able to define beta reduction.====Free variables====The '''free variables''' of a term are those variables not bound by a lambda abstraction. The set of free variables of an expression is defined inductively:* The free variables of<math>x</math>are just<math>x</math>* The set of free variables of<math>\lambda x.t</math>is the set of free variables of<math>t</math>, but with<math>x</math>removed* The set of free variables of<math>ts</math>is the union of the set of free variables of<math>t</math>and the set of free variables of<math>s</math>.For example, the lambda term representing the identity<math>\lambda x.x</math>has no free variables, but the function<math>\lambda x.x+y</math>has a single free variable,<math>y</math>.====Capture-avoiding substitutions====Suppose<math>t</math>,<math>s</math>and<math>r</math>are lambda terms and<math>x</math>and<math>y</math>are variables.The notation<math>t[x := r]</math>indicates substitution of<math>r</math>for<math>x</math>in<math>t</math>in a ''capture-avoiding'' manner. This is defined so that:*<math>x[x := r] = r</math>.*<math>y[x := r] = y</math>if<math>x \neq y</math>.*<math>(ts)[x := r] = (t[x := r])(s[x := r])</math>.*<math>(\lambda x.t)[x := r] = \lambda x.t</math>.*<math>(\lambda y.t)[x := r] = \lambda y.(t[x := r])</math>if<math>x \neq y</math>and<math>y</math>is not in the free variables of<math>r</math>. The variable<math>y</math>is said to be""fresh""for<math>r</math>.For example,<math>(\lambda x.x)[y := y] = \lambda x.(x[y := y]) = \lambda x.x</math>, and<math>((\lambda x.y)x)[x := y] = ((\lambda x.y)[x := y])(x[x := y]) = (\lambda x.y)y</math>.The freshness condition (requiring that<math>y</math>is not in the free variables of<math>r</math>)  is crucial in order to ensure that substitution does not change the meaning of functions.For example, a substitution is made that ignores  the freshness condition:<math>(\lambda x.y)[y := x] = \lambda x.(y[y := x]) = \lambda x.x</math>. This substitution turns the constant function<math>\lambda x.y</math>into the identity<math>\lambda x.x</math>by substitution.In general, failure to meet the freshness condition can be remedied by alpha-renaming with a suitable fresh variable.For example, switching back to our correct notion of substitution, in<math>(\lambda y.x)[x := y]</math>the lambda abstraction can be renamed with a fresh variable<math>z</math>, to obtain<math>(\lambda z.x)[x := y] = \lambda z.(x[x := y]) = \lambda z.y</math>, and the meaning of the function is preserved by substitution.====Beta reduction====The beta reduction rule states that an application of the form<math>( \lambda x . t) s</math>reduces to the term<math>t [ x := s]</math>. The notation<math>( \lambda x . t ) s \to t [ x := s ]</math>is used to indicate that<math>( \lambda x .t ) s</math>beta reduces to<math>t [ x := s ]</math>.For example, for every<math>s</math>,<math>( \lambda x . x ) s \to x[ x := s ] = s</math>. This demonstrates that<math>\lambda x . x</math>really is the identity.Similarly,<math>( \lambda x . y ) s \to y [ x := s ] = y</math>, which demonstrates that<math>\lambda x . y</math>is a constant function.The lambda calculus may be seen as an idealised functional programming language, like [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] or [[Standard ML]].Under this view, beta reduction corresponds to a computational step. This step can be repeated by additional beta conversions until there are no more applications left to reduce. In the untyped lambda calculus, as presented here, this reduction process may not terminate.For instance, consider the term<math>( \lambda x . xx)( \lambda x . xx )</math>.Here<math>( \lambda x . xx)( \lambda x . xx) \to ( xx )[ x := \lambda x . xx ] = ( x [ x := \lambda x . xx ] )( x [ x := \lambda x . xx ] ) = ( \lambda x . xx)( \lambda x . xx )</math>.That is, the term reduces to itself in a single beta reduction, and therefore the reduction process will never terminate.Another aspect of the untyped lambda calculus is that it does not distinguish between different kinds of data.For instance, it may be desirable to write a function that only operates on numbers. However, in the untyped lambda calculus, there is no way to prevent a function from being applied to [[truth value]]s,  strings, or other non-number objects.==Formal definition=====Definition===Lambda expressions are composed of* variables v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, ..., v<sub>n</sub>, ...* the abstraction symbols lambda 'λ' and dot '.'* parentheses ( )The set of lambda expressions, Λ, can be [[Recursive definition|defined inductively]]:#If x is a variable, then x ∈ Λ#If x is a variable and M ∈ Λ, then (λx.M) ∈ Λ#If M, N ∈ Λ, then (M N) ∈ ΛInstances of rule 2 are known as abstractions and instances of rule 3 are known as applications.<ref>{{Citation| last = Barendregt| first = Hendrik Pieter| author-link =| last2 =| first2 =| author2-link =| title = The Lambda Calculus: Its Syntax and Semantics| place =| publisher = North Holland, Amsterdam.

Variables that fall within the scope of an abstraction are said to be ''bound''. All other variables are called ''free''.

Closed lambda expressions are also known as combinators and are equivalent to terms in [[combinatory logic]].==Reduction==The meaning of lambda expressions is defined by how expressions can be reduced.<ref>[[Ruy de Queiroz |de Queiroz, Ruy J.G.B.]]""[http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1746-8361.1988.tb00919.x A Proof-Theoretic Account of Programming and the Role of Reduction Rules.]""''Dialectica'' '''42'''(4), pages 265-282, 1988.</ref>There are three kinds of reduction:* '''α-conversion''': changing bound variables ('''alpha''').* '''β-reduction''': applying functions to their arguments ('''beta''').* '''η-conversion''': which captures a notion of extensionality ('''eta''').We also speak of the resulting equivalences: two expressions are ''β-equivalent'', if they can be β-converted into the same expression, and α/η-equivalence are defined similarly.The term ''redex'', short for ''reducible expression'', refers to subterms that can be reduced by one of the reduction rules. For example,<tt>(λ''x''.M) N</tt>is a beta-redex in expressing the substitution of N for x in M. if<tt>''x''</tt>is not free in<tt>M</tt>,<tt>λ''x''.M ''x''</tt>is an eta-redex. The expression to which a redex reduces is called its reduct. using the previous example, the reducts of these expressions are respectively<tt>M[''x'':=N]</tt>and<tt>M</tt>.===α-conversion===Alpha-conversion, sometimes known as alpha-renaming,<ref>{{Citation |title=Design concepts in programming languages |last1=Turbak |first1=Franklyn |last2=Gifford |first2=David |year=2008 |publisher=MIT press |page=251| isbn=978-0-262-20175-9}}</ref>allows bound variable names to be changed. For example, alpha-conversion of<tt>λ''x''.''x''</tt>might yield<tt>λ''y''.''y''</tt>. Terms that differ only by alpha-conversion are called ''α-equivalent''. Frequently, in uses of lambda calculus, α-equivalent terms are considered to be equivalent.The precise rules for alpha-conversion are not completely trivial. First, when alpha-converting an abstraction, the only variable occurrences that are renamed are those that are bound to the same abstraction. For example, an alpha-conversion of<tt>λ''x''.λ''x''.''x''</tt>could result in<tt>λ''y''.λ''x''.''x''</tt>, but it could ''not'' result in<tt>λ''y''.λ''x''.''y''</tt>. The latter has a different meaning from the original.Second, alpha-conversion is not possible if it would result in a variable getting captured by a different abstraction. For example, if we replace<tt>''x''</tt>with<tt>''y''</tt>in<tt>λ''x''.λ''y''.''x''</tt>, we get<tt>λ''y''.λ''y''.''y''</tt>, which is not at all the same.In programming languages with static scope, alpha-conversion can be used to make [[name resolution]] simpler by ensuring that no variable name [[Variable shadowing|masks]] a name in a containing [[scope (programming)|scope]] (see [[Name resolution#Alpha renaming to make name resolution trivial|alpha renaming to make name resolution trivial]]).In the [[De Bruijn index]] notation, any two alpha-equivalent terms are literally identical.====Substitution====Substitution, written<tt>''E''[''V'' := ''R'']</tt>, is the process of replacing all free occurrences of the variable<tt>''V''</tt>in the expression<tt>''E''</tt>with expression<tt>''R''</tt>.Substitution on terms of the λ-calculus is defined by recursion on the structure of terms, as follows (note: x and y are only variables while M and N are any λ expression).:<tt>''x''[''x'' := N]&nbsp.&nbsp.&nbsp.&nbsp.&nbsp.&nbsp.&equiv. N</tt>:<tt>''y''[''x'' := N]&nbsp.&nbsp.&nbsp.&nbsp.&nbsp.&nbsp.&equiv. ''y'', if ''x'' ≠ ''y''</tt>:<tt>(M<sub>1</sub>M<sub>2</sub>)[''x'' := N]&nbsp.&nbsp.&equiv. (M<sub>1</sub>[''x'' := N]) (M<sub>2</sub>[''x'' := N])</tt>:<tt>(λ''x''.M)[''x'' := N]&nbsp.&equiv. λ''x''.M</tt>:<tt>(λ''y''.M)[''x'' := N]&nbsp.&equiv. λ''y''.(M[''x'' := N]), if ''x'' ≠ ''y'', ''provided'' ''y'' ∉ FV(N)</tt>To substitute into a lambda abstraction, it is sometimes necessary to α-convert the expression. For example, it is not correct for<tt>(λ''x''.''y'')[''y'' := ''x'']</tt>to result in<tt>(λ''x''.''x'')</tt>, because the substituted<tt>''x''</tt>was supposed to be free but ended up being bound. The correct substitution in this case is<tt>(λ''z''.''x'')</tt>, up to α-equivalence. Notice that substitution is defined uniquely up to α-equivalence.===&beta.-reduction===Beta-reduction captures the idea of function application. Beta-reduction is defined in terms of substitution: the beta-reduction of<tt>&nbsp.((λ''V''.''E'') ''E&prime.'')&nbsp.</tt>is<tt>''E''[''V'' := ''E&prime.'']</tt>.For example, assuming some encoding of<tt>2, 7,&times.</tt>, we have the following β-reduction:<tt>((λ''n''.''n''&times.2) 7)</tt>→<tt>7&times.2</tt>.===&eta.-conversion===Eta-conversion expresses the idea of [[extensionality]], which in this context is that two functions are the same [[if and only if]] they give the same result for all arguments. Eta-conversion converts between<tt>λ''x''.(''f'' ''x'')</tt>and<tt>''f''</tt>whenever<tt>''x''</tt>does not appear free in<tt>''f''</tt>.== Normal forms and confluence =={{Main|Normalization property (abstract rewriting)}}For the untyped lambda calculus, β-reduction as a [[rewrite system|rewriting rule]] is neither [[strongly normalising]] nor [[weakly normalising]].However, it can be shown that β-reduction is [[confluence (abstract rewriting)|confluent]]. (Of course, we are working up to α-conversion, i.e. we consider two normal forms to be equal, if it is possible to α-convert one into the other.)Therefore, both strongly normalising terms and weakly normalising terms have a unique normal form. For strongly normalising terms, any reduction strategy is guaranteed to yield the normal form, whereas for weakly normalising terms, some reduction strategies may fail to find it.==Encoding datatypes=={{Main|Church encoding|Mogensen–Scott encoding}}The basic lambda calculus may be used to model booleans, [[arithmetic]], data structures and recursion, as illustrated in the following sub-sections.===Arithmetic in lambda calculus===There are several possible ways to define the [[natural number]]s in lambda calculus, but by far the most common are the [[Church numeral]]s, which can be defined as follows::<tt>0 := λ''f''.λ''x''.''x''</tt>:<tt>1 := λ''f''.λ''x''.''f'' ''x''</tt>:<tt>2 := λ''f''.λ''x''.''f'' (''f'' ''x'')</tt>:<tt>3 := λ''f''.λ''x''.''f'' (''f'' (''f'' ''x''))</tt>and so on. Or using the alternative syntax presented above in ''[[#Notation|Notation]]''::<tt>0 := λ''fx''.''x''</tt>:<tt>1 := λ''fx''.''f'' ''x''</tt>:<tt>2 := λ''fx''.''f'' (''f'' ''x'')</tt>:<tt>3 := λ''fx''.''f'' (''f'' (''f'' ''x''))</tt>A Church numeral is a [[higher-order function]]—it takes a single-argument function<tt>''f''</tt>, and returns another single-argument function. The Church numeral<tt>''n''</tt>is a function that takes a function<tt>''f''</tt>as argument and returns the<tt>''n''</tt>-th composition of<tt>''f''</tt>, i.e. the function<tt>''f''</tt>composed with itself<tt>''n''</tt>times.

Two other definitions of<tt>PRED</tt>are given below, one using [[#Logic and predicates|conditionals]] and the other using [[#Pairs|pairs]]. With the predecessor function, subtraction is straightforward. Defining:<tt>SUB := λ''m''.λ''n''.''n'' PRED ''m''</tt>,<tt>SUB ''m'' ''n''</tt>yields<tt>''m'' − ''n''</tt>when<tt>''m''>''n''</tt>and<tt>0</tt>otherwise.===Logic and predicates===By convention, the following two definitions (known as Church booleans) are used for the boolean values<tt>TRUE</tt>and<tt>FALSE</tt>::<tt>TRUE := λ''x''.λ''y''.''x''</tt>:<tt>FALSE := λ''x''.λ''y''.''y''</tt>::(Note that<tt>FALSE</tt>is equivalent to the Church numeral zero defined above)Then, with these two λ-terms, we can define some logic operators (these are just possible formulations. other expressions are equally correct)::<tt>AND := λ''p''.λ''q''.''p'' ''q'' ''p''</tt>:<tt>OR := λ''p''.λ''q''.''p'' ''p'' ''q''</tt>:<tt>NOT := λ''p''.λ''a''.λ''b''.''p'' ''b'' ''a''</tt>:<tt>IFTHENELSE := λ''p''.λ''a''.λ''b''.''p'' ''a'' ''b''</tt>We are now able to compute some logic functions, for example::<tt>AND TRUE FALSE</tt>::<tt>≡ (λ''p''.λ''q''.''p'' ''q'' ''p'') TRUE FALSE →<sub>β</sub>TRUE FALSE TRUE</tt>::<tt>≡ (λ''x''.λ''y''.''x'') FALSE TRUE →<sub>β</sub>FALSE</tt>and we see that<tt>AND TRUE FALSE</tt>is equivalent to<tt>FALSE</tt>.A ''predicate'' is a function that returns a boolean value. The most fundamental predicate is<tt>ISZERO</tt>, which returns<tt>TRUE</tt>if its argument is the Church numeral<tt>0</tt>, and<tt>FALSE</tt>if its argument is any other Church numeral::<tt>ISZERO := λ''n''.''n'' (λ''x''.FALSE) TRUE</tt>The following predicate tests whether the first argument is less-than-or-equal-to the second::<tt>LEQ := λ''m''.λ''n''.ISZERO (SUB ''m'' ''n'')</tt>,and since<tt>''m'' = ''n''</tt>, if<tt>LEQ ''m'' ''n''</tt>and<tt>LEQ ''n'' ''m''</tt>, it is straightforward to build a predicate for numerical equality.The availability of predicates and the above definition of<tt>TRUE</tt>and<tt>FALSE</tt>make it convenient to write""if-then-else""expressions in lambda calculus. For example, the predecessor function can be defined as::<tt>PRED := λ''n''.''n'' (λ''g''.λ''k''.ISZERO (''g'' 1) ''k'' (PLUS (''g'' ''k'') 1)) (λ''v''.0) 0</tt>which can be verified by showing inductively that<tt>''n'' (λ''g''.λ''k''.ISZERO (''g'' 1) ''k'' (PLUS (''g'' ''k'') 1)) (λ''v''.0)</tt>is the add<tt>''n''</tt>− 1 function for<tt>''n''</tt>>0.===Pairs===A pair (2-tuple) can be defined in terms of<tt>TRUE</tt>and<tt>FALSE</tt>, by using the [[Church encoding#Church pairs|Church encoding for pairs]]. For example,<tt>PAIR</tt>encapsulates the pair (<tt>''x''</tt>,<tt>''y''</tt>),<tt>FIRST</tt>returns the first element of the pair, and<tt>SECOND</tt>returns the second.:<tt>PAIR := λ''x''.λ''y''.λ''f''.''f'' ''x'' ''y''</tt>:<tt>FIRST := λ''p''.''p'' TRUE</tt>:<tt>SECOND := λ''p''.''p'' FALSE</tt>:<tt>NIL := λ''x''.TRUE</tt>:<tt>NULL := λ''p''.''p'' (λ''x''.λ''y''.FALSE)</tt>A linked list can be defined as either NIL for the empty list, or the<tt>PAIR</tt>of an element and a smaller list. The predicate<tt>NULL</tt>tests for the value<tt>NIL</tt>. (Alternatively, with<tt>NIL := FALSE</tt>, the construct<tt>''l'' (λ''h''.λ''t''.λ''z''.deal_with_head_''h''_and_tail_''t'') (deal_with_nil)</tt>obviates the need for an explicit NULL test).As an example of the use of pairs, the shift-and-increment function that maps<tt>(''m'', ''n'')</tt>to<tt>(''n'', ''n'' + 1)</tt>can be defined as:<tt>Φ := λ''x''.PAIR (SECOND ''x'') (SUCC (SECOND ''x''))</tt>which allows us to give perhaps the most transparent version of the predecessor function::<tt>PRED := λ''n''.FIRST (''n'' Φ (PAIR 0 0)).</tt>===Recursion and fixed points==={{Main|Fixed-point combinator}}{{see also|SKI combinator calculus#Self-application_and_recursion}}[[Recursion]] is the definition of a function using the function itself. on the face of it, lambda calculus does not allow this (we can't refer to a value which is yet to be defined, inside the lambda term defining that same value, as all functions are anonymous in lambda calculus). However, this impression is misleading: in&ensp.<tt>(λ''x''.''x'' ''x'') ''y''</tt>&ensp.both ''x''‍&thinsp.‍'s refer to the same lambda term, ''y'', so it is possible for a lambda expression&ndash. here ''y''&ndash. to be arranged to receive itself as its argument value, through self-application.Consider for instance the [[factorial]] function<tt>F(''n'')</tt>recursively defined by:<tt>F(''n'') = 1, if ''n'' = 0. else ''n''&times. F(''n'' − 1)</tt>.In the lambda expression which is to represent this function, a ''parameter'' (typically the first one) will be assumed to receive the lambda expression itself as its value, so that calling it&ndash. applying it to an argument&ndash. will amount to recursion. Thus to achieve recursion, the intended-as-self-referencing argument (called<tt>''r''</tt>here) must always be passed to itself within the function body, at a call point::<tt>G := λ''r''. λ''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0. else ''n''&times. (''r'' ''r'' (''n''−1)))</tt>::: with&ensp.<tt>''r'' ''r'' ''x'' = F ''x'' = G ''r'' ''x''</tt>&ensp.to hold, so&ensp.<tt>''r'' = G</tt>&ensp.and:<tt>F := G G = (λ''x''.''x'' ''x'') G</tt>The self-application achieves replication here, passing the function's lambda expression on to the next invocation as an argument value, making it available to be referenced and called there.This solves it but requires re-writing each recursive call as self-application. We would like to have a generic solution, without a need for any re-writes::<tt>G := λ''r''. λ''n''.(1, if ''n'' = 0. else ''n''&times.

The function does not need to be explicitly passed to itself at any point, for the self-replication is arranged in advance, when it is created, to be done each time it is called. Thus the original lambda expression<tt>(FIX G)</tt>is re-created inside itself, at call-point, achieving [[self-reference]].In fact, there are many possible definitions for this<tt>FIX</tt>operator, the simplest of them being::<tt>'''Y''' := λ''g''.(λ''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x'')) (λ''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x''))</tt>In the lambda calculus,<tt>'''Y''' ''g''</tt>&thinsp. is a fixed-point of<tt>''g''</tt>, as it expands to::<tt>'''Y''' ''g''</tt>:<tt>λ''h''.((λ''x''.''h'' (''x'' ''x'')) (λ''x''.''h'' (''x'' ''x''))) ''g''</tt>:<tt>(λ''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x'')) (λ''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x''))</tt>:<tt>''g'' ((λ''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x'')) (λ''x''.''g'' (''x'' ''x'')))</tt>:<tt>''g'' ('''Y''' ''g'')</tt>Now, to perform our recursive call to the factorial function, we would simply call<tt>('''Y''' G) ''n''</tt>,&nbsp. where ''n'' is the number we are calculating the factorial of.

In this context, types are usually objects of a syntactic nature that are assigned to lambda terms. the exact nature of a type depends on the calculus considered (see kinds below). From a certain point of view, typed lambda calculi can be seen as refinements of the [[untyped lambda calculus]] but from another point of view, they can also be considered the more fundamental theory and  ''untyped lambda calculus'' a special case with only one type.Typed lambda calculi are foundational [[programming languages]] and are the base of typed [[functional programming languages]] such as [[ML programming language|ML]] and Haskell and, more indirectly, typed [[imperative programming|imperative programming languages]]. Typed lambda calculi play an important role in the design of [[type systems]] for programming languages. here typability usually captures desirable properties of the program, e.g. the program will not cause a memory access violation.Typed lambda calculi are closely related to [[mathematical logic]] and [[proof theory]] via the [[Curry&ndash.Howard isomorphism]] and they can be considered as the [[internal language]] of classes of [[category theory|categories]], e.g. the simply typed lambda calculus is the language of [[cartesian closed category|Cartesian closed categories]] (CCCs).==Computable functions and lambda calculus==A function ''F'': '''N''' → '''N''' of natural numbers is a computable function if and only if there exists a lambda expression ''f'' such that for every pair of ''x'', ''y'' in '''N''', ''F''(''x'')=''y'' if and only if ''f''<tt>''x''</tt>&nbsp.=<sub>β</sub>&nbsp.<tt>''y''</tt>,&nbsp. where<tt>''x''</tt>and<tt>''y''</tt>are the Church numerals corresponding to ''x'' and ''y'', respectively and =<sub>β</sub>meaning equivalence with beta reduction. This is one of the many ways to define computability. see the [[Church-Turing thesis]] for a discussion of other approaches and their equivalence.==Undecidability of equivalence==There is no algorithm that takes as input two lambda expressions and outputs<tt>TRUE</tt>or<tt>FALSE</tt>depending on whether or not the two expressions are equivalent. This was historically the first problem for which undecidability could be proven. As is common for a proof of undecidability, the proof shows that no computable function can decide the equivalence. [[Church's thesis]] is then invoked to show that no algorithm can do so.Church's proof first reduces the problem to determining whether a given lambda expression has a ''normal form''. A normal form is an equivalent expression that cannot be reduced any further under the rules imposed by the form. Then he assumes that this predicate is computable, and can hence be expressed in lambda calculus. Building on earlier work by Kleene and constructing a [[Gödel numbering]] for lambda expressions, he constructs a lambda expression<tt>''e''</tt>that closely follows the proof of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]]. If<tt>''e''</tt>is applied to its own Gödel number, a contradiction results.==Lambda calculus and programming languages==As pointed out by [[Peter Landin]]'s 1965 paper<cite>[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=363749&coll=portal&dl=ACM A Correspondence between ALGOL 60 and Church's Lambda-notation]</cite>, sequential [[procedural programming|procedural programming languages]] can be understood in terms of the lambda calculus, which provides the basic mechanisms for procedural abstraction and procedure (subprogram) application.Lambda calculus [[Reification (computer science)|reifies]]""functions""and makes them first-class objects, which raises implementation complexity when it is implemented.===Anonymous functions==={{main|Anonymous function}}For example in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] the 'square' function can be expressed as a lambda expression as follows:<!-- Please do not add the same example in different languages to this article, see Anonymous function for that. Thank you! --><source lang=""Lisp"">(lambda (x) (* x x))</source>The above example is an expression that evaluates to a first-class function. The symbol<code>lambda</code>creates an anonymous function, given a list of parameter names,<code>(x)</code>&mdash. just a single argument in this case, and an expression that is evaluated as the body of the function,<code>(* x x)</code>. The Haskell example is identical. Anonymous functions are sometimes called lambda expressions.For example [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and many other imperative languages have long supported passing [[subprograms]] as [[arguments]] to other subprograms through the mechanism of [[function pointers]]. However, function pointers are not a sufficient condition for functions to be [[First-class function|first class]] datatypes, because a function is a first class datatype if and only if new instances of the function can be created at run-time. And this run-time creation of functions is supported in [[Smalltalk]], [[Javascript]], and more recently in [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] (""agents""), [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] (""delegates"") and [[C++11]], among others.===Reduction strategies==={{details|Evaluation strategy}}Whether a term is normalising or not, and how much work needs to be done in normalising it if it is, depends to a large extent on the reduction strategy used. The distinction between reduction strategies relates to the distinction in functional programming languages between [[eager evaluation]] and [[lazy evaluation]]..Full beta reductions: Any redex can be reduced at any time. This means essentially the lack of any particular reduction strategy—with regard to reducibility,""all bets are off""..Applicative order: The leftmost, innermost redex is always reduced first. Intuitively this means a function's arguments are always reduced before the function itself. Applicative order always attempts to apply functions to normal forms, even when this is not possible.:Most programming languages (including Lisp, ML and imperative languages like C and [[Java programming language|Java]]) are described as""strict"", meaning that functions applied to non-normalising arguments are non-normalising. This is done essentially using applicative order, call by value reduction ([[#Call by value|see below]]), but usually called""eager evaluation""..Normal order: The leftmost, outermost redex is always reduced first. That is, whenever possible the arguments are substituted into the body of an abstraction before the arguments are reduced..Call by name: As normal order, but no reductions are performed inside abstractions. For example<tt>λ''x''.(λ''x''.''x'')''x''</tt>is in normal form according to this strategy, although it contains the redex<tt>(λ''x''.''x'')''x''</tt>..Call by value: Only the outermost redexes are reduced: a redex is reduced only when its right hand side has reduced to a value (variable or lambda abstraction)..Call by need: As normal order, but function applications that would duplicate terms instead name the argument, which is then reduced only""when it is needed"". Called in practical contexts""lazy evaluation"". In implementations this""name""takes the form of a pointer, with the redex represented by a [[thunk (functional programming)|thunk]].Applicative order is not a normalising strategy. The usual counterexample is as follows: define<tt>'''Ω''' = ωω</tt>where<tt>'''ω''' = λ''x''.''xx''</tt>. This entire expression contains only one redex, namely the whole expression. its reduct is again<tt>'''Ω'''</tt>. Since this is the only available reduction,<tt>'''Ω'''</tt>has no normal form (under any evaluation strategy). Using applicative order, the expression<tt>'''KIΩ''' = (λ''x''.λ''y''.''x'') (λ''x''.''x'')'''Ω'''</tt>is reduced by first reducing<tt>'''Ω'''</tt>to normal form (since it is the rightmost redex), but since<tt>'''Ω'''</tt>has no normal form, applicative order fails to find a normal form for<tt>'''KIΩ'''</tt>.In contrast, normal order is so called because it always finds a normalising reduction, if one exists. In the above example,<tt>'''KIΩ'''</tt>reduces under normal order to ''I'', a normal form. A drawback is that redexes in the arguments may be copied, resulting in duplicated computation (for example,<tt>(λ''x''.''xx'') ((λ''x''.''x'')''y'')</tt>reduces to<tt>((λ''x''.''x'')''y'') ((λ''x''.''x'')''y'')</tt>using this strategy. now there are two redexes, so full evaluation needs two more steps, but if the argument had been reduced first, there would now be none).The positive tradeoff of using applicative order is that it does not cause unnecessary computation, if all arguments are used, because it never substitutes arguments containing redexes and hence never needs to copy them (which would duplicate work). In the above example, in applicative order<tt>(λ''x''.''xx'') ((λ''x''.''x'')''y'')</tt>reduces first to<tt>(λ''x''.''xx'')''y''</tt>and then to the normal order<tt>''yy''</tt>, taking two steps instead of three.Most ''purely'' functional programming languages (notably [[Miranda (programming language)|Miranda]] and its descendents, including Haskell), and the proof languages of [[Automated theorem prover|theorem prover]]s, use ''lazy evaluation'', which is essentially the same as call by need. This is like normal order reduction, but call by need manages to avoid the duplication of work inherent in normal order reduction using ''sharing''. In the example given above,<tt>(λ''x''.''xx'') ((λ''x''.''x'')''y'')</tt>reduces to<tt>((λ''x''.''x'')''y'') ((λ''x''.''x'')''y'')</tt>, which has two redexes, but in call by need they are represented using the same object rather than copied, so when one is reduced the other is too.===A note about complexity===While the idea of beta reduction seems simple enough, it is not an atomic step, in that it must have a non-trivial cost when estimating [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]].<ref>R. Statman,""[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4567929 The typed&lambda.-calculus is not elementary recursive.]""''Theoretical Computer Science'', (1979) '''9''' pp73-81.</ref>To be precise, one must somehow find the location of all of the occurrences of the bound variable<tt>''V''</tt>in the expression<tt>''E''</tt>, implying a time cost, or one must keep track of these locations in some way, implying a space cost.

This has led to the study of systems that use [[explicit substitution]]. Sinot's [[director string]]s<ref>F.-R.

This means that various [[evaluation strategy#Nondeterministic strategies|nondeterministic evaluation strategies]] are relevant. However, the lambda calculus does not offer any explicit constructs for [[parallel computing|parallelism]]. One can add constructs such as [[Futures and promises|Futures]] to the lambda calculus. Other [[process calculi]] have been developed for describing communication and concurrency.==Semantics==The fact that lambda calculus terms act as functions on other lambda calculus terms, and even on themselves, led to questions about the semantics of the lambda calculus. Could a sensible meaning be assigned to lambda calculus terms? The natural semantics was to find a set ''D'' isomorphic to the function space ''D'' → ''D'', of functions on itself. However, no nontrivial such ''D'' can exist, by [[cardinality]] constraints because the set of all functions from ''D'' to ''D'' has greater cardinality than ''D'', unless ''D'' is a [[singleton set]].In the 1970s, [[Dana Scott]] showed that, if only [[Scott continuity|continuous functions]] were considered, a set or [[Domain theory|domain]] ''D'' with the required property could be found, thus providing a [[Model theory|model]] for the lambda calculus.This work also formed the basis for the [[denotational semantics]] of programming languages.==See also=={{colbegin|colwidth=30em}}* [[Applicative computing systems]] – Treatment of [[object (computer science)|object]]s in the style of the lambda calculus* [[Binary lambda calculus]] – A version of lambda calculus with binary I/O, a binary encoding of terms, and a designated universal machine.* [[Calculus of constructions]] – A typed lambda calculus with [[type system|type]]s as first-class values* [[Cartesian closed category]] – A setting for lambda calculus in [[category theory]]* [[Categorical abstract machine]] – A [[model of computation]] applicable to lambda calculus* [[Combinatory logic]] – A notation for mathematical logic without variables* [[Curry&ndash.Howard isomorphism]] – The formal correspondence between programs and [[mathematical proof|proof]]s* [[Deductive lambda calculus]] – The consideration of the problems associated with considering lambda calculus as a [[Deductive system]].* [[Domain theory]] – Study of certain [[partially ordered sets|posets]] giving [[denotational semantics]] for lambda calculus* [[Evaluation strategy]] – Rules for the evaluation of expressions in [[programming language]]s* [[Explicit substitution]] – The theory of substitution, as used in [[#β-reduction|β-reduction]]* [[Harrop formula]] – A kind of constructive logical formula such that proofs are lambda terms* [[Kappa calculus]] – A first-order analogue of lambda calculus* [[Kleene&ndash.Rosser paradox]] – A demonstration that some form of lambda calculus is inconsistent* [[Knights of the Lambda Calculus]] – A semi-fictional organization of LISP and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]]s* [[Lambda calculus definition]] - Formal definition of the lambda calculus.* [[Lambda cube]] – A framework for some extensions of typed lambda calculus* [[Lambda-mu calculus]] – An extension of the lambda calculus for treating [[classical logic]]* [[Let expression]] – An expression close related to a lambda abstraction.* [[Minimalism (computing)]]* [[Rewriting]] – Transformation of formulæ in formal systems* [[SECD machine]] – A [[virtual machine]] designed for the lambda calculus* Simply typed lambda calculus - Version(s) with a single type constructor* [[SKI combinator calculus]] – A computational system based on the '''[[#S|S]]''', '''[[#K|K]]''' and '''[[#I|I]]''' combinators* [[System F]] – A typed lambda calculus with type-variables* [[Typed lambda calculus]] – Lambda calculus with typed variables (and functions)* [[Universal Turing machine]] – A formal computing machine that is equivalent to lambda calculus* [[Unlambda]] – An [[esoteric programming language|esoteric]] functional programming language based on combinatory logic{{colend}}==Further reading==*Abelson, Harold&Gerald Jay Sussman.

Hero System"; ''[[Fantasy Hero]]'', ''[[Star Hero]]'', and ''[[Pulp Hero]]''. It is characterized by point-based character creation and the rigor with which it measures character abilities. It uses only six-sided [[dice]].==System features==The ''HERO System'' character creation system is entirely points-based with no random elements. Players are given a pool of points, the size of which varies depending on the campaign type, with which to buy Characteristics, Skills, Talents, and Powers. They can gain additional points by taking Disadvantages that hamper their character in play.Abilities in the ''HERO System'', particularly Powers (a broad category that includes superpowers, magic, psionics, and high technology), are modeled based on their effects. The player chooses an effect the power models (such as Energy Blast) and chooses a set of modifiers to fine-tune the power's function. Each modifier makes the Power more or less expensive.Tasks are resolved using three six-sided dice and Power effects (especially damage) are resolved by rolling a number of dice based on the power's level.Unlike the [[d20 System]] and many other game systems, experience awards are in the form of character points, which have the same value as those used in character creation and can be applied directly to the character's abilities upon receipt.===Character creation===The ''HERO System'''s biggest innovation was its use of a point-based system for character creation with a tool-kit approach to creating abilities. The rules only define the ability's effects in combat—the player defines what the ability looks like when used.  For example, the ability to project a jet of fire could be bought as""Energy Blast,""or any of a number of other abilities.  The player then defines it as a""jet of fire,""with all that implies: it has the possibility of starting secondary fires. it looks, smells and sounds like a jet of fire. etc. This Energy Blast could be modified by any number of modifiers such as""Explosion,""""Area of Effect""or""No Range.""These affect how the power works as well as its final cost.Each player creates his character starting with a pool of points to buy abilities (such as the aforementioned""Energy Blast""and""Armor""), increase characteristics (such as""Strength""and""Intelligence"") and buy skills (such as""Computer Programming""and""Combat Driving"").  This pool can be increased by taking disadvantages for your character (such as being hunted by an enemy, a dependency of some sort or having people who depend on your character in some way).  The initial pool, as well as the final pool size, is determined by the [[gamemaster|Game Master]] (GM), as well as the point limits on each individual ability.===Advantages and disadvantages===The advantages of the ''HERO System ''are commonly{{Who|date=September 2010}} considered to be:#It eases [[game balance]] issues for the GM: characters of similar point totals are usually of roughly equal power.#It is very flexible in character creation, allowing players to create nearly any character they can imagine.#It uses only six-sided [[dice]], as generally used in many board games.The primary disadvantages are commonly considered to be:#Complexity, as character generation provides a sometimes overwhelming number of options and requires more mathematical computation than other games (but see [[#Mathematics issues|""Mathematics issues""]] below).#The great amount of time it can take to adjudicate combat.#The ability for players familiar with the system's quirks to use the system to decrease the point cost of powers, leading to one character being much more powerful than another character of similar point value.#A large number of dice required at high power levelsThe""large number of dice required at high power levels""has been called both an advantage and a disadvantage.  The original designers, and some contemporary players, have cited a""feeling of power""when rolling large numbers of dice and counting off huge amounts of damage.  On the other hand, rolling such a large load of dice can be physically unwieldy and take a long time to add up.===Powers===The powers system is divided into a set of standard powers, and a list of advantages and limitations that can be applied to each power. Many of the powers have specific advantages and limitations that apply only to that power. The powers in the HERO System are categorized roughly as follows::*'''Adjustment Powers''' — Modify the Characteristics of self or another.:*'''Attack Powers''' — Inflict physical damage or some other negative effect on an opponent.:*'''Body-Affecting Powers''' — Change shape, size, density, etc.:*'''Defense Powers''' — Protect against an attack or mishap.:*'''Mental Powers''' — Detect and/or affect the mind of another.:*'''Movement Powers''' — Employ various forms of movement.:*'''Sense-Affecting Powers''' — Alter or hinder a character's senses.:*'''Sensory Powers''' — Improve or expand upon the sensory abilities.:*'''Size Powers''' — Growth and Shrinking.:*'''Special Powers''' — Powers with some unusual quality, including ones that do not fall into the other categories.:*'''Standard Powers''' — A""catch-all""for Powers that are not Adjustment, Mental, Movement, Size, or Special Powers.Within each of these categories are multiple Powers that have more specialized effects. Thus for the movement category there are powers that can be used for [[Running]], [[human swimming|Swimming]], [[Climbing]], [[Jumping|Leaping]], [[Gliding]], [[flight|Flying]], [[Tunnel]]ing through solid surfaces, and even [[Teleportation]]. For certain game [[genre]]s there are even powers for traveling to other dimensions or moving faster than light.Also, many Powers appear in at least two categories.  For example, most Attack Powers are also Standard Powers, and Size Powers are basically just a subcategory of Body-Affecting Powers.  Darkness is in three categories — Standard, Attack, and Sense-Affecting.====Point Cost====Each power has a base point cost for a given effect. This could be, for example, a certain number of points per six-sided-die (or""d6"") of damage inflicted upon a foe.Powers can have both advantages and limitations.  Both are modifiers applied at different stages in calculating cost.  These modifiers are typically changes of ±¼, but can range up to ±2 or even higher.After the base cost is calculated, advantages are applied.  These, which can make a power more useful, typically expand its effectiveness or make it more powerful, and thus make it more expensive.  Once advantages are applied, the base cost becomes the Active Cost.The Active Cost is calculated as an intermediate step as it is required to calculate certain figures, such as range, END usage, difficulty of activation rolls, and other things.The formula for calculating the Active Cost is::'''Active Cost''' = '''Base Cost'''&times. (1 + ''Advantages'')Once Active Cost is calculated, limitations are applied.  These represent shortcomings in the power, lessened reliability or situations in which the power can not be used.  Limitations are added separately as positive numbers, even though they are listed as negative.The Real Cost of the power is then determined by::'''Real Cost''' = '''Active Cost''' / (1 + ''Limitations'')The Real Cost is the amount the character must actually pay for the Power.====Power Frameworks====The rules also include schemes for providing a larger number of powers to a character for a given cost. These power frameworks reduce the cost either by requiring the group of powers to have a common theme as in an Elemental Control Framework, or by limiting the number of powers that can be active at one time with a Multipower Framework. Powers within a framework can share common limitations, further reducing the cost. A third type of power framework, the Variable Power Pool (VPP), trades thrift for flexibility. With it, powers can be arbitrarily chosen on the fly, granting enhanced in-game flexibility. The price is a premium on points, called the Control Cost.  Additionally, it is marked as potentially unbalancing, so not all GMs will permit VPP's.Elemental Controls were eliminated in the Sixth Edition.===Mathematics issues===One of the criticisms leveled at the ''HERO System'' almost since its inception is the relatively large amount of computation involved in its use, particularly during character creation. While almost none of this math goes beyond the basic functions of [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and [[division (mathematics)|division]] (certain obscure and completely optional situations ''may'' call for a [[logarithm]]ic function), this can seem daunting to newcomers.As a result, [[software]] has been created to automate the bookkeeping involved.""Heromaker"", an [[MS-DOS]] program, was distributed with some versions of [[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]. Today,""Hero Designer""<ref>[http://www.herodesigner.com/home.htm""Hero Designer: Character creation software for HERO System, 5th Edition""], vendor website</ref>for the Fifth and Sixth Editions is available on several platforms, and is supported by numerous character packs and other extensions linked to Hero Games book releases.==Publishing history==''See also:''  [[List of Hero System Products]]Although several games based on the ''HERO System'' were published in the 1980s, including ''[[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]'', ''[[Danger International]]'', ''[[Justice, Inc. (role-playing game)|Justice, Inc.]]'', ''[[Robot Warriors]]'' and the original versions of ''[[Fantasy HERO]]'' and ''[[Star HERO]]'', each of the RPGs was self-contained, much as [[Chaosium]]'s [[Basic Role-Playing]] games are. The ''HERO System'' itself was not released as an independent entity until 1989, as [[Steve Jackson Games]]' ''[[GURPS]]'' (''Generic Universal Roleplaying System'') became more popular. As a joint venture between Hero Games and [[Iron Crown Enterprises]], a stand-alone ''HERO System Rulebook'' was published alongside the fourth edition of Champions. The content was identical to the opening sections of the Champions rules, but all genre-related material was removed. Afterward, genre books such as ''Ninja HERO'' (written by [[Aaron Allston]]) and ''[[Fantasy HERO]]'' were published as sourcebooks for the ''HERO System Rulebook'' as opposed to being independent games.With the collapse of the Hero-ICE alliance, the ''HERO System'' went into limbo for several years. ''The Champions'' franchise released a new version under the [[Fuzion]] system, which had been a joint development with [[R. Talsorian Games]], called ''Champions: the New Millennium''. Although two editions were published, it was very poorly received by ''Champions'' fans. In 2001, a reconstituted Hero Games was formed under the leadership of [[Steven S. Long]], who had written several books for the earlier version of the system. It regained the rights to the ''HERO System'' and to the ''Champions'' trademark.In 2001, the Fifth Edition of the ''HERO System Rulebook'' was released, incorporating heavy revisions by Long. A large black hardcover, it was critically well received and attained a degree of commercial success. (Following problems with fragile [[Bookbinding|bindings]] on Fourth Edition rulebooks, the planned binding for the larger Fifth Edition was tested using a clothes dryer.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20051123133645/http://herogames.com/news/2002/0125.jsp""News""], Hero Games website, January 25, 2002</ref>) The Fifth Edition is often referred to as""FREd"", which is a [[backronym]] for""Fifth Rules Edition"". The name actually comes from Steve S. Long's reply when asked what the standard abbreviation for the Fifth Edition would be:""I don't care if you call it 'Fred', as long as you buy it.""A revised version (ISBN 1-58366-043-7) was issued in 2004, along with ''HERO System Sidekick'', a condensed version of the rulebook with a cover price of under $10. Fans often call the revised Fifth Edition""Fiver,""ReFREd,""or""5ER""(from""Fifth Edition revised"".""Fiver""also alludes to ''[[Watership Down]]''). This rulebook is so big (592 pages) that some fans speculated that it might be bulletproof, and it did indeed stop some bullets when tested by Hero Games staffers.<ref>[http://www.herogames.com/forums/showthread.php?t=54793""5ER Bulletproof Video""], Steve Long, Hero Games forum.

One of the new features will be to allow players to adapt their ''[[Champions Online]]'' characters to the pen-and-paper game.<ref name=""championspurchase"">{{cite web|url=http://crypticstudios.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=174&Itemid=32|title=Cryptic Studios Announces Champions Online|publisher=[[Cryptic Studios]]|quote=Cryptic Studios also announced today that it has acquired the ''Champions'' intellectual property (IP) from Hero Games. First published in 1981, the ''Champions'' role-playing game is one of the first RPGs to forgo the traditional dice-rolling system of character generation in favor of a point-based system. Cryptic Studios has licensed back to Hero Games the rights to produce Champions RPG books, and the sixth edition of the HERO System and ''Champions'', set to release in 2009, will include rules on how to recreate Champions Online characters and scenarios.}}</ref>In late 2008, Hero released a licensed RPG for [[Aaron Williams (cartoonist)|Aaron Williams]]'s popular comic [[PS238]] using a simplified version of the Fifth Edition rules.In late 2009, Hero Games released the 6th Edition of the Hero System. The game has so far had a mostly positive reception, with little in the way of 'Edition Wars'.Among other changes, there are no Figured Characteristics - All Characteristics, including the formerly Figured, are bought separately. Other, more minor rules changes include folding Armor and Force field into Resistant Defense and reestablishing Regeneration as a separate power. The rules were released in two volumes, with the first covering character creation in depth and the second describing campaigns and the running of games. The new genre book for Champions came out shortly thereafter, and a new ''Fantasy HERO'' was released in the summer of 2010. A new version of Sidekick was released in late 2009 under the title ''The HERO System Basic Rulebook'', while an Advanced Player Guide was published that had additional options for character creation. Other recent releases included a large book of pre-constructed Powers, a set of pre-generated Martial Arts styles, abilities and skills, a large bestiary, a new [[grimoire]] for Fantasy Hero and a three-volume set of villains for ''Champions''. A new edition of ''Star HERO'' was released in 2011, along with a second Advanced Player Guide.In 2011, Hero Games announced a restructuring, with long-time developer Steven S. Long relinquishing his full-time status to work freelance. In late 2012 ''Champions Complete'' was released, which contained all of the core 6th edition rules as well as enough information to play a superhero campaign in a single 240-page book. This compact presentation reflected criticism that the 6th edition rules had become too unwieldy.Mirroring the shrinking of much of the table-top games industry, Hero Games now maintains an irregular release schedule, with a minimal staff, and has successfully used [[Kickstarter]] to raise funds for new projects. One of these new products, ''Fantasy Hero Complete'', was released in early 2015.==References==<references/>==External links==*[http://www.herogames.com/ HERO Games] Company website*{{dmoz|Games/Roleplaying/Genres/Universal/Hero_System}}{{Hero 5E}}{{RPG systems}}[[Category:Hero System| ]][[Category:Universal role-playing games]]"

Wheelock's ostensible inspiration for such an establishment resulted from his relationship with [[Mohegan]] Indian [[Samson Occom]]. Occom became an ordained minister after studying under Wheelock from 1743 to 1747, and later moved to [[Long Island]] to preach to the [[Montaukett|Montauks]].<ref name=""history-lesson""/>Wheelock founded [[Moor's Charity School|Moor's Indian Charity School]] in 1755.<ref name=""Eleazar Wheelock's Two Schools""/>The Charity School proved somewhat successful, but additional funding was necessary to continue school's operations, and Wheelock sought the help of friends to raise money. Occom, accompanied by the Reverend Nathaniel Whitaker, traveled to England in 1766 to raise money from churches. With these funds, they established a trust to help Wheelock.<ref name=""history-lesson""/>The head of the trust was a [[Methodist]] named [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth]].[[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-10-02 03 - Charter.jpg|thumb|upright|The Charter of Dartmouth College on display in [[Baker Memorial Library]]. The Charter was signed on December 13, 1769, on behalf of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III of Great Britain]].]]Although the fund provided Wheelock ample financial support for the Charity School, Wheelock had trouble recruiting Indians to the institution, primarily because its location was far from tribal territories. In seeking to expand the school into a college, Wheelock relocated it to Hanover, in the [[Province of New Hampshire]]. The move from Connecticut followed a lengthy and sometimes frustrating effort to find resources and secure a charter. The Royal Governor of New Hampshire, [[Sir John Wentworth, 1st Baronet|John Wentworth]], provided the land upon which Dartmouth would be built and on December 13, 1769, issued the charter in the name of [[King George III]] establishing the College. That charter created a college""for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, writing&all parts of Learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing&christianizing Children of Pagans as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences and also of English Youth and any others.""The reference to educating Native American youth was included to connect Dartmouth to the Charity School and enable use of the Charity School's unspent trust funds. Named for [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth]]—an important supporter of Eleazar Wheelock's earlier efforts but who, in fact, opposed creation of the College and never donated to it—Dartmouth is the nation's ninth oldest college and the last institution of higher learning established under Colonial rule.<ref name=""About Dartmouth&nbsp.– History""/>The College granted its first degrees in 1771.<ref name=""Eleazar Wheelock and the Adventurous Founding of Dartmouth College""/>Given the limited success of the Charity School, however, Wheelock intended his new college as one primarily for whites.<ref name=""history-lesson""/><ref name=""chi""/>Occom, disappointed with Wheelock's departure from the school's original goal of Indian [[Christianization]], went on to form his own community of New England Indians called [[Brothertown Indians]] in New York.<ref name=""history-lesson""/><ref name=""chi""/>[[File:Early Dartmouth Dunham.jpg|thumb|left|The earliest known image of Dartmouth appeared in the February 1793 issue of ''Massachusetts Magazine''.

The phrase appears five times in the Bible and is a reference to the college's location on what was once the frontier of European settlement.<ref name=""good""/><ref name=""Bartlett Hall's Wheelock Memorial Window""/>Richard Hovey's""[[Alma Mater (Dartmouth College)|Men of Dartmouth]]""was elected as the best of Dartmouth's songs in 1896,<ref name=""homecoming-history""/>and became the school's official song in 1926.<ref name=""Follow-up on the news. Song out of tune with the times""/>The song was retitled to""Alma Mater""in the 1980s when its lyrics were changed to refer to women as well as men.<ref name=""rscl""/>=== Seal ==={{Main|Seal of Dartmouth College}}[[File:Seal of Dartmouth College.png|thumb|upright|left|Seal of Dartmouth College]]Dartmouth's 1769 royal charter required the creation of a [[seal (emblem)|seal]] for use on official documents and diplomas.<ref name=""charter""/>The college's founder [[Eleazar Wheelock]] designed a seal for his college bearing a striking resemblance to the seal of the [[USPG|Society for the Propagation of the Gospel]], a missionary society founded in London in 1701, in order to maintain the illusion that his college was more for mission work than for higher education.<ref name=""good""/>Engraved by a Boston silversmith, the seal was ready by commencement of 1773. The trustees officially accepted the seal on August 25, 1773, describing it as:{{quote|An Oval, circumscribed by a Line containing SIGILL: COL: DARTMUTH: NOV: HANT: IN AMERICA 1770. within projecting a Pine Grove on the Right, whence proceed Natives towards an Edifice two Storey on the left. which bears in a Label over the Grove these Words""vox clamantis in deserto""the whole supported by Religion on the Right and Justice on the Left, and bearing in a Triangle irradiate, with the Hebrew Words [El Shaddai], agreeable to the above Impression, be the common Seal under which to pass all Diplomas or Certificates of Degrees, and all other Affairs of Business of and concerning Dartmouth College.<ref name=""collections""/>}}On October 28, 1926, the trustees affirmed the charter's reservation of the seal for official corporate documents alone.<ref name=""good""/>The College Publications Committee commissioned noted typographer [[William Addison Dwiggins|W. A. Dwiggins]] to create a line drawing version of the seal in 1940 that saw widespread use. Dwiggins' design was modified during 1957 to change the date from""1770""to""1769"", to accord with the date of the college charter. The trustees commissioned a new set of dies with a date of""1769""to replace the old dies, now badly worn after almost two hundred years of use.<ref name=""good""/>The 1957 design continues to be used under trademark number 2305032.<ref name=""uspatent""/>=== Shield ===On October 28, 1926, the trustees approved a""Dartmouth College Shield""for general use. Artist and engraver W. Parke Johnson designed this emblem on the basis of the shield that is depicted at the center of the original seal. This design does not survive. On June 9, 1944, the trustees approved another [[coat of arms]] based on the shield part of the seal, this one by Canadian artist and designer [[Thoreau MacDonald]]. That design was used widely and, like Dwiggins' seal, had its date changed from""1770""to""1769""around 1958.<ref name=""good""/>That version continues to be used under trademark registration number 3112676 and others.<ref name=""uspatent""/>College designer John Scotford made a stylized version of the shield during the 1960s, but it did not see the success of MacDonald's design.<ref name=""A Proposal for a Heraldic Coat of Arms for Dartmouth College""/>The shield appears to have been used as the basis of the shield of [[Dartmouth Medical School]], and it has been reproduced in sizes as small as 20 micrometers across.<ref name=""Nanometer Pattern Generation System: Dartmouth Seal""/>The design has appeared on [[Rudolph Ruzicka]]'s Bicentennial Medal ([[Philadelphia Mint]], 1969) and elsewhere.=== Nickname, symbol, and mascot ===Dartmouth has never had an official [[mascot]].<ref name=""ad-green""/>The nickname""The Big Green,""originating in the 1860s, is based on students' adoption of a shade of forest green (""Dartmouth Green"") as the school's official color in 1866.<ref name=""greencolor""/><ref name=""History-of-Dartmouth-Hanover""/>Beginning in the 1920s, the Dartmouth College athletic teams were known by their unofficial nickname""the Indians"", a moniker that probably originated among sports journalists.<ref name=""ad-green""/>This unofficial mascot and team name was used until the early 1970s, when its use came under criticism. In 1974, the Trustees declared the""use of the [Indian] symbol in any form to be inconsistent with present institutional and academic objectives of the College in advancing Native American education.""<ref name=""The 'Big Green' Nickname""/>Some alumni and students, as well as the conservative student newspaper, ''[[The Dartmouth Review]]'', have sought to return the Indian symbol to prominence,<ref name=""Dartmouth Indians: The New Tradition""/>but never succeeded in doing so.<ref name=""The Banning of the Indian""/>Various student initiatives have been undertaken to adopt a new mascot, but none has become""official"". One proposal devised by the college humor magazine the ''[[Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern]]'' was [[Keggy the Keg]], an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] beer keg who makes occasional appearances at college sporting events. Despite student enthusiasm for Keggy,<ref name=""Straight from the Tap: the men behind the mascot""/>the mascot has received approval from only the student government.<ref name=""thedartmouth4""/>In November 2006, student government attempted to revive the""Dartmoose""as a potential replacement amid renewed controversy surrounding the former Indian mascot.<ref name=""First SA meeting draws crowd""/>== Alumni =={{Main|List of Dartmouth College alumni}}Dartmouth's alumni are known for their devotion to the college.<ref name=""ihe-alum""/>Most start by giving to the Senior Class Gift.

What a patent holder has is the right to exclude others from doing what they normally are free to do. So the inclusion of the words granting the right to""use""and""sell""can be construed as meaning no more than the licensee has all the rights they would normally have under a copyright grant. There is no need to infer that these commonly used words mean that the licensor was waiving its patent right to exclude others from such activity (and indeed presumes that the licensor had any such patent rights to exclude to begin with). Whether or not a court might imply a patent grant under the MIT license therefore remains an open question.The [[Simplified BSD license]] used by [[FreeBSD]] is essentially identical{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}{{discuss|tag not related to statement}} to the MIT License, as it contains neither an advertising clause, nor a prohibition on promotional use of the copyright holder's name.Also similar in terms is the [[ISC license]], which has simpler language.The [[University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License]] combines text from both the MIT and BSD licenses. the license grant and disclaimer are taken from the MIT License.==See also==* [[:Category:Software using the MIT license]]* [[Comparison of free and open-source software licenses]]{{Portal|Free software}}==References=={{Reflist}}==External links==* [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:MIT?rd=Licensing/MIT MIT License variants]* [http://www.opensource.org/licenses/MIT The MIT License template] (Open Source Initiative official site)* [http://www.jclark.com/xml/copying.txt Expat License]* [http://www.xfree86.org/3.3.6/COPYRIGHT2.html#3 X11 License]{{FOSS}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Mit License}}[[Category:Free and open-source software licenses]][[Category:X Window System]][[Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]"

It was initially popularized in Chicago, circa 1984. House music quickly spread to other American cities like Detroit, New York City, and Newark - all of which developed their own regional scenes. In the mid-to-late 1980s, house music became popular in Europe as well as major cities in South America, and Australia.<ref name=unesco_4>{{cite journal | url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001201/120152e.pdf | title=The club DJ: a brief history of a cultural icon | publisher=UNESCO | date=July–August 2000 | last=Fikentscher | first=Kai | journal=UNESCO Courier | page=47 | quote=Around 1986/7, after the initial explosion of house music in [[Chicago]], it became clear that the major recording companies and media institutions were reluctant to market this genre of music, associated with gay African Americans, on a mainstream level. House artists turned to Europe, chiefly London but also cities such as Amsterdam, Berlin,  Manchester, Milan, Zurich, and Tel Aviv.&nbsp....

Since the early to mid-1990s, house music has been infused in mainstream [[Pop music|pop]] and [[dance music]] worldwide.Early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive [[Four on the floor (music)|4/4]] beats, rhythms mainly provided by [[drum machine]]s,<ref name=""allmusic"">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/house-ma0000002651 |title=House : Significant Albums, Artists and Songs, Most Viewed |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2012-10-12}}</ref>off-beat [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to [[disco]] music, it was more electronic and minimalistic,<ref name=""allmusic""/>and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. House music in the 2010s, while keeping several of these core elements, notably the prominent [[kick drum]] on every beat, varies a lot in style and influence, ranging from the soulful and atmospheric [[deep house]] to the more minimalistic [[microhouse]]. House music has also fused with several other genres creating fusion subgenres,<ref name=""allmusic""/>such as [[Eurodance|euro house]], [[tech house]], [[electro house]] and [[Jump House (music genre)|jump house]].In the late 1980s, many local Chicago house music artists suddenly found themselves presented with major label deals. House music proved to be a commercially successful genre and a more mainstream [[popular music|pop-based]] variation grew increasingly popular.

After enjoying significant success in the early to mid-90s, house music grew even larger during the second wave of [[progressive house]] (1999–2001).

Early British house music quickly set itself apart from the original Chicago house sound.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} many of the early hits were based on [[sampling (music)|sample]] montage, [[rap]] was often used for vocals (far more than in the US),{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} and [[humor]] was frequently an important element.{{Listen|filename=Yazz - The Only Way Is Up.ogg|title=Yazz -""The Only Way Is Up""(1988)|description=The acid house record""[[The Only Way Is Up]]""by [[Yazz]] was the second best-selling British single of 1988.|pos=right}}The second best-selling British single of 1988 was an acid house record, the [[Coldcut]]-produced""[[The Only Way Is Up]]""by [[Yazz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pure80spop.co.uk/bestsellerssingles.htm |title=Best selling singles of the 80s |publisher=Pure80spop.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Chart Archive - 1980s Singles|url=http://www.everyhit.com/chart4.html|publisher=EveryHit.com|accessdate=2012-08-04}}</ref>One of the early anthemic tunes,""Promised Land""by Joe Smooth, was covered and charted within a week by [[the Style Council]]. Europeans embraced house, and began booking legendary American house DJs to play at the big clubs, such as [[Ministry of Sound]], whose resident, [[Justin Berkmann]] brought in [[Larry Levan]].The house scene in cities such as [[Birmingham]], [[Leeds]], [[Sheffield]] and London were also provided with many underground [[Pirate Radio]] stations and DJs alike which helped bolster an already contagious, but otherwise ignored by the mainstream, music genre. The earliest and influential UK house and techno record labels such as [[Warp Records]] and [[Network Records]] (otherwise known as Kool Kat records) helped introduce American and later Italian dance music to Britain as well as promoting select UK dance music acts.But house was also being developed on [[Ibiza]],{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} although no house artists or labels were coming from this tiny island at the time. By the mid-1980s a distinct [[Balearic Beat|Balearic]] mix of house was discernible.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Several clubs like Amnesia with DJ Alfredo were playing a mix of rock, pop, disco and house. These clubs, fueled by their distinctive sound and [[ecstasy (drug)|Ecstasy]], began to have an influence on the British scene. By late 1987, DJs like [[Trevor Fung]], [[Paul Oakenfold]] and [[Danny Rampling]] were bringing the Ibiza sound to UK clubs like [[the Haçienda]] in Manchester, and in London clubs such as Shoom in Southwark, [[Heaven (nightclub)|Heaven]], Future and Spectrum.In the U.S., the music was being developed to create a more sophisticated sound,{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} moving beyond just drum loops and short samples. In Chicago, Marshall Jefferson had formed the house group [[Ten City]] [[Byron Burke]], [[Byron Stingily]]&Herb Lawson(from""intensity""). New York–based performers such as [[Mateo&Matos]] and [[Blaze (band)|Blaze]] had slickly produced disco house tracks.  In [[Detroit]] a proto-[[techno music]] sound began to emerge with the recordings of Juan Atkins, Derrick May and Kevin Saunderson.Atkins, a former member of [[Cybotron (band)|Cybotron]], released Model 500""No UFOs""in 1985, which became a regional hit, followed by dozens of tracks on Transmat, Metroplex and Fragile. One of the most unusual was""Strings of Life""by Derrick May, a darker, more intellectual strain of house.""Techno-Scratch""was released by the [[Knights Of The Turntable]] in 1984 which had a similar techno sound to Cybotron. The manager of the [[The Factory (music venue)|Factory nightclub]] and co-owner of the Haçienda, [[Tony Wilson]], also promoted acid house culture on his weekly TV show. The Midlands also embraced the late 1980s house scene with illegal parties and more legal dance clubs such as The Hummingbird.===US: late 1980s&ndash.early 1990s===[[File:Paradise garage.jpg|thumb|right|Building in New York City where the [[Paradise Garage]] nightclub was located]]Back in America the scene had still not progressed beyond a small number of clubs in Chicago, Detroit, [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] and [[New York City]]. However, many independent Chicago-based record labels were making appearances on the Dance Chart with their releases. In the UK, any house song released by a Chicago-based label was routinely considered a must play at many clubs playing house music. [[Paradise Garage]] in New York City was still a top club. The emergence of [[Todd Terry]], a pioneer of the genre, was important in America. His cover of Class Action's Larry Levan mixed""Weekend""demonstrated the continuum from the underground disco to a new house sound with hip-hop influences evident in the quicker sampling and the more rugged bass-line.In the late 1980s, [[Nu Groove Records]] prolonged, if not launched the careers of [[Rheji Burrell]]&[[Rhano Burrell]], collectively known as Burrell (after a brief stay on Virgin America via [[Timmy Regisford]] and [[Frank Mendez]]), along with basically every relevant DJ and Producer in the NY underground scene. The Burrell's are responsible for the""New York Underground""sound and are the undisputed champions of this style of house. Their 30+ releases on this label alone seems to support that fact. In today's market Nu Groove Record releases like the Burrells' enjoy a cult-like following and mint vinyl can fetch $100 U.S. or more in the open market.By the late 80s, House had moved West, particularly to San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles, Fresno, San Diego and Seattle. Los Angeles saw a huge explosion of underground raves and DJs, notably DJs Marques Wyatt and Billy Long, who spun at Jewel's Catch One, the oldest dance club in America.  In 1989, the L.A. based, former [[EBN-OZN]] singer/rapper [[Robert Ozn]] started indie house label One Voice Records, releasing the Mike Hitman Wilson remix of [[Dada Nada]]'s""Haunted House,""which garnered instant club and mix show radio play in Chicago, Detroit and New York as well as in the U.K. and France. The record shot up to Number Five on the Billboard Club Chart, marking it as the first House record by a white artist to chart in the U.S.  Dada Nada, the moniker for Ozn's solo act, released in 1990, what has become a classic example of jazz-based Deep House, the [[Frankie Knuckles]] and [[David Morales]] remix of Dada Nada's""Deep Love""(One Voice Records/US, Polydor/UK), featuring Ozn's lush, crooning vocals and muted trumpet improvisational solos, underscoring Deep House's progression into a genre that integrated jazz and pop songwriting structures - a feature which continued to set it apart from Acid House and Techno.The early 1990s additionally saw the rise in mainstream US popularity for house music. Pop recording artist [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s 1990 single""[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]""became an international hit single and topped the US charts.<ref name=""ReferenceB"">{{cite web|last=Bush |first=John |url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/essay/house-relation-to-soul-t2156 |title=Rockin' Robin - Bobby Day : Listen, Appearances, Song Review Secret (Some Bizarre Single Mix)Remix – Bizarre Inc released the house single 1994 |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref>The single is credited as helping to bring house music to the US mainstream.<ref name=""ReferenceB""/>Influential [[gospel music|gospel]]/[[R&B]]-influenced Aly-us released""Time Passes On""in 1993 ([[Strictly Rhythm]]), then later,""Follow Me""which received radio airplay as well as being played in clubs.  Another U.S. hit which received radio play was the single""Time for the Perculator""by [[Cajmere]], which became the prototype of [[ghetto house]] subgenre.  Cajmere started the Cajual and Relief labels (amongst others). By the early 1990s artists such as Cajmere himself (under that name as well as [[Green Velvet]] and as producer for [[Dajae]]), [[DJ Sneak]], Glenn Underground and others did many recordings. The 1990s saw new Chicago house artists emerge such as [[DJ Funk]], who operates a Chicago house record label called [[Dance Mania (record label)|Dance Mania]]. Ghetto house and [[acid house]] were other house music styles that were also started in Chicago.===Late 1980s&ndash.1990s==={{See also|Eurodance|French House|Ambient house|Tech house}}{{Off-topic|date=March 2011}}In Britain, further experiments in the genre boosted its appeal. House and [[rave]] clubs like Lakota and [[Cream (nightclub)|Cream]] emerged across Britain, hosting house and dance scene events. The 'chilling out' concept developed in Britain with [[ambient house]] albums such as [[The KLF]]'s ''[[Chill Out]]'' and ''[[Analogue Bubblebath Vol I|Analogue Bubblebath]]'' by [[Aphex Twin]]. The [[Godskitchen]] superclub brand also began in the midst of the early 90's rave scene. After initially hosting small nights in [[Cambridge]] and [[Northampton]], the associated events scaled up in [[Milton Keynes]], [[Birmingham]] and [[Leeds]]. A new indie dance scene also emerged in the 90's. In New York, bands such as [[Deee-Lite]] furthered house's international influence. Two distinctive tracks from this era were [[the Orb]]'s""[[Little Fluffy Clouds]]""(with a distinctive vocal sample from [[Rickie Lee Jones]]) and the [[Happy Mondays]]'""Wrote for Luck""(""WFL"") which was transformed into a dance hit by [[Vince Clarke]].In England, one of the few licensed venues [[The Eclipse (venue)|The Eclipse]] attracted people from up and down the country as it was open until the early hours. The [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] was a government attempt to ban large rave dance events featuring music with""repetitive beats"". There were a number of abortive""Kill the Bill""demonstrations. The [[Spiral Tribe]] at Castle Morten was probably the nail in the coffin for illegal raves, and forced through the bill, which became law, in November 1994. The music continued to grow and change, as typified by [[Leftfield]] with""[[Release the Pressure]]"", which introduced dub and [[reggae]] into the house sound, although Leftfield had prior releases, such as""Not Forgotten""released in 1990 on Sheffield's Outer Rhythm records.A new generation of clubs like, [[Liverpool]]'s [[Cream (nightclub)|Cream]]  and the [[Ministry of Sound]] were opened to provide a venue for more commercial sounds. Major record companies began to open""[[superclub]]s""promoting their own acts. These superclubs entered into sponsorship deals initially with fast food, soft drinks, and clothing companies. Flyers in clubs in [[Ibiza]] often sported many corporate logos. A new subgenre, Chicago hard house, was developed by DJs such as [[Bad Boy Bill]], [[DJ Lynnwood]], [[DJ Irene]], [[Richard""Humpty""Vission]] and [[DJ Enrie]], mixing elements of Chicago house, funky house and hard house together. Additionally, Producers such as George Centeno, Darren Ramirez, and Martin O. Cairo would develop the Los Angeles Hard House sound. Similar to [[gabber]] or [[hardcore techno]] from the Netherlands, this sound was often associated with the""rebel""culture of the time. These 3 producers are often considered""ahead of their time""since many of the sounds they engineered during the late 20th century became more prominent during the 21st century.Towards the end of the 1990s and into the 2000s, producers like [[Daft Punk]], [[Stardust (band)|Stardust]], [[Cassius (band)|Cassius]], [[St. Germain (musician)|St. Germain]] and [[DJ Falcon]] began producing a new sound out of Paris's house scene. Together, they laid the groundwork for what would be known as the [[French house]] movement. By combining the harder-edged-yet-soulful philosophy of Chicago house with the melodies of obscure funk, state-of-the-art production techniques and the sound of analog synthesizers, they began to create the standards that would shape all house music.==21st century=={{Section OR|date=May 2012}}===2000s==={{See also|Electroclash|Electro house}}Chicago Mayor [[Richard M. Daley]] proclaimed August 10, 2005 to be""House Unity Day""in Chicago, in celebration of the""21st anniversary of house music""(actually the 21st anniversary of the founding of [[Trax Records]], an independent Chicago-based house label). The proclamation recognized Chicago as the original home of house music and that the music's original creators""were inspired by the love of their city, with the dream that someday their music would spread a message of peace and unity throughout the world"". DJs such as [[Frankie Knuckles]], [[Marshall Jefferson]], [[Paul Johnson (DJ)|Paul Johnson]] and [[Mickey Oliver]] celebrated the proclamation at the Summer Dance Series, an event organized by Chicago's Department of Cultural Affairs.<ref>{{cite journal |date=2005-08-03 |title=Chicago Mayor Declares 'House Unity Day' |url=http://remixmag.com/transmissions/chicago-house-080405/ |journal=Remix |publisher=Penton Media, Inc. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917031408/http://remixmag.com/transmissions/chicago-house-080405/ |archivedate=2009-09-17}}</ref>{{Listen|filename=Electro House Loop.ogg|title=Electro house loop|description=This short loop demonstrates the style of a modern [[electro house]] track, including a house beat and""dirty""bass.|pos=right}}It was during this decade that vocal house became firmly established, both in the underground and as part of the pop market, and labels such as [[Defected Records]], Roule and Om were at the forefront of championing the emerging sound. In the mid-2000s, fusion genres such as [[electro house]] and [[fidget house]] emerged.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} This fusion is apparent in the crossover of musical styles by artists such as [[Dennis Ferrer]] and [[Booka Shade]], with the former's production style having evolved from the New York soulful house scene and the latter's roots in [[techno]].Numerous live performance events dedicated to house music were founded during the course of the decade, including [[Shambhala Music Festival]] and major industry sponsored events like Miami's [[Winter Music Conference]]. The genre even gained popularity in the [[Middle East]] in cities such as [[Dubai]]&[[Abu Dhabi]]{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} and at events like [[Creamfields]].In the late 2000s, house witnessed renewed chart success thanks to acts such as [[Daft Punk]],  [[Deadmau5]], [[Steve Aoki]], [[Fedde Le Grand]], [[Armand Van Helden]], and [[Dada Life]].===2010s==={{Unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}{{See also|Electro house|Progressive house}}[[File:Swedish House Mafia and Benny Benassi.jpg|thumb|[[Swedish House Mafia]] performing in 2011.]]2010s saw multiple new sounds in house music developed by numerous DJs. Sweden knew a prominence of snare-less""Swedish [[progressive house]]""with the emergence of [[Sebastian Ingrosso]], [[Axwell]], [[Steve Angello]] (These three formed a trio called [[Swedish House Mafia]]), [[Avicii]], [[Alesso]], etc. Netherlands brought together a concept of""Dirty Dutch"", [[electro house]] subgenre characterized by very abrasive leads and darker arpeggios, with prominent DJs [[Chuckie (DJ)|Chuckie]], [[Hardwell]], [[Laidback Luke]], [[Afrojack]], [[R3hab]], [[Bingo Players]], [[Quintino]], [[Alvaro]]{{disambiguation needed|date=January 2015}}, [[Cedric Gervais]], 2G, etc. Elsewhere, fusion genres derivative of 2000s progressive house returned to prominence, especially with the help of DJs [[Calvin Harris]], [[Eric Prydz]], [[Mat Zo]], [[Above&Beyond (band)|Above&Beyond]] and [[Fonzerelli]] in Europe, [[Deadmau5]], [[Kaskade]], [[Steve Aoki]], [[Porter Robinson]] and [[Wolfgang Gartner]] in the US and Canada. The growing popularity of such artists led to the emergence of electro house and progressive house blended sounds in popular music, such as singles [[Lady Gaga]]'s""[[Marry the Night]]"", [[The Black Eyed Peas]]'""[[The Best One Yet (The Boy)]]""and the [[will.i.am]] and [[Britney Spears]]""[[Scream&Shout]]"". Big room house found increasing popularity since 2010, particularly through international dance music festivals such as [[Tomorrowland (festival)|Tomorrowland]], [[Ultra Music Festival]], and [[Electric Daisy Carnival]].In addition to these popular examples of house, there has also been a reunification of contemporary house and its roots. Many hip hop and R&B artists also turn to house beats to add a mass appeal to the music they produce. Examples include Kelly Rowland's""Love Takes Over""feat. David Guetta, Rihanna's""We Found Love""feat. Calvin Harris and Kid Cudi's""Memories""also feat. David Guetta.[[Deep House]] surged onto the UK Top 40 in 2014 with artists such as [[Duke Dumont]] and [[Secondcity]] earning number 1 hits with the sound, albeit with commercial pop influences.==See also=={{Portal|Electronic music}}* [[House dance]]* [[List of electronic music genres]]* [[List of house artists]]* [[Styles of house music]]==Notes=={{Reflist|2}}==Further reading==* Bidder, Sean (2002).
