  abstract = {A great deal of research has focused on algorithms for learning features
	from unlabeled data. Indeed, much progress has been made on benchmark
	datasets like NORB and CIFAR by employing increasingly complex unsupervised
	learning algorithms and deep models. In this paper, however, we show
	that several very simple factors, such as the number of hidden nodes
	in the model, may be as important to achieving high performance as
	the choice of learning algorithm or the depth of the model. Specifically,
	we will apply several off-the-shelf feature learning algorithms (sparse
	auto-encoders, sparse RBMs and K-means clustering, Gaussian mixtures)
	to NORB and CIFAR datasets using only single-layer networks. We then
	present a detailed analysis of the effect of changes in the model
	setup: the receptive field size, number of hidden nodes (features),
	the step-size (“stride”) between extracted features, and the effect
	of whitening. Our results show that large numbers of hidden nodes
	and dense feature extraction are as critical to achieving high performance
	as the choice of algorithm itself—so critical, in fact, that when
	these parameters are pushed to their limits, we are able to achieve
	state-of-theart performance on both CIFAR and NORB using only a single
	layer of features. More surprisingly, our best performance is based
	on K-means clustering, which is extremely fast, has no hyper-parameters
	to tune beyond the model structure itself, and is very easy implement.
	Despite the simplicity of our system, we achieve performance beyond
	all previously published results on the CIFAR-10 and NORB datasets
	(79.6 % and 97.0 % accuracy respectively). 1},

	using a variety of singleimage depth cues, for example, by recognizing
	objects and surfaces, and reasoning about how these surfaces are
	connected to each other. In this paper, we focus on the problem of
	automatic 3d reconstruction of indoor scenes, specifically ones (sometimes
	called “Manhattan worlds”) that consist mainly of orthogonal planes.
	We use a Markov random field (MRF) model to identify the different
	planes and edges in the scene, as well as their orientations. Then,
	an iterative optimization algorithm is applied to infer the most
	probable position of all the planes, and thereby obtain a 3d reconstruction.
	Our approach is fully automatic—given an input image, no human intervention
	is necessary to obtain an approximate 3d reconstruction. 1},

  abstract = {Abstract 1 Motivated in part by the hierarchical organization of the
	neocortex, a number of recently proposed algorithms have tried to
	learn hierarchical, or “deep, ” structure from unlabeled data. While
	several authors have formally or informally compared their algorithms
	to computations performed in visual area V1 (and the cochlea), little
	attempt has been made thus far to evaluate these algorithms in terms
	of their fidelity for mimicking computations at deeper levels in
	the cortical hierarchy. This thesis describes an unsupervised learning
	model that faithfully mimics certain properties of visual area V2.
	Specifically, we develop a sparse variant of the deep belief networks
	described by Hinton et al. (2006). We learn two layers of representation
	in the network, and demonstrate that the first layer, similar to
	prior work on sparse coding and ICA, results in localized, oriented,
	edge filters, similar to the gabor functions known to model simple
	cell receptive fields in area V1. Further, the second layer in our
	model encodes various combinations of the first layer responses in
	the data. Specifically, it picks up both collinear (“contour”) features
	as well as corners and junctions. More interestingly, in a quantitative
	comparison, the encoding of these more complex “corner ” features
	matches well with the results from Ito &amp; Komatsu’s study of neural
	responses to angular stimuli in area V2 of the macaque. This suggests
	that our sparse variant of deep belief networks holds promise for
	modeling more higher-order features that are encoded in visual cortex.
	Conversely, one may also interpret the results reported here as suggestive
	that visual area V2 is performing computations on its input similar
	to those performed in (sparse) deep belief networks. This plausible
	relationship generates some intriguing hypotheses about V2 computations.

	When using an SVM for classification, we further show how a Fisher
	kernel can be learned for this representation. 1.},
