Stressful and Poor living conditions as exterior depressive approach
Afghanistan has been in war science 1979 from war against Soviet union to civil war
then the war against NATO, adding to this the cultural and living conditions Afghanistan 
have become one of the most stressful living environments and in addition to 
"This leading to a numerous number of Psychiatric disorder including Traumatic Stress Disorder" [Abdul Wali 1993]
Recent advances in research regarding the effect of stress on telomere and it's relation to stress-related ageing of molecules 
and cells, and the association of short telmoere length  with advancing chronological age, "Emerging studies suggest that 
stress accelerates the erosion of telomeres from very early in life and possibly even influences the 
initial (newborn) setting of telomere length"[Shalev et al, 2013]

This introduction could lead us to the following analysis of some examples of the effect of stressful and poor living conditions on the
beauty and as a result on the life time of several people:
let's begin with the iconic photo of the 80s "the Afghani girl", [Image of the Girl]Sharbat Gula is an Afghani girl who were living in Afghanistan and moved to 
Pakistan as a refugee and a famous photo of her were shot on 1984 when she was 12 years old on 2002 the photographer of the photo searched for
her in Afghanistan to recapture the effect of time on here and managed to capture another photo of her at the age of about 30.As you can see now 
on the two images side by side, you cannot believe that  the difference between the two images is only 17 years 
[Two Images side by side]

Another example is at the most stressful job in the world the president of the united states of America , we will take president Bill Clinton(in office for
8 years 1993-2001) as an example what you are seeing now is an official photo at the very early days of his first presidency term and the other photo is 
8 years later while leaving the chair to president George W. Bush. although only 8 years passed between the two photos but the ageing apparent on the face of 
Clinton maybe interpreted as about 12-16 years. Although it worth mentioning that a "even assuming accelerated ageing during office,
most of the presidents who died of natural causes still outlived men who were the same age at their inauguration." [Olshansky, 2011] , which is not the case
for Sharbat Gula that at the age of 30 with no access to medical care can barely be as outfit as women in her late fifties in other countries.

To this we can conclude that although it's not the only factor but the surrounding stress and living condition can be a great factor of showing the ageing symptoms
on a person's outfit even if it's not affecting it's overall health condition with access to medical care.
